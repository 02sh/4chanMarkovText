if im not, is there any other catch to kinky girls that im unaware of?
my bad
Now that you're here, would you like to talk about starting strength?
you must achieve a level 5 squat to catch a kinky girl
tell us about your kinks anon
You haven't divorced anything if you keep desiring it. Get OFF my BOARD with your LOW TEST CRAP
I suggest GOMAD and 5x5 for the first 6-12 months then go for ULxUL or PPL depending omn on which suits you best.
What would you do? I'm naturally jealous i guess, but this doesn't seem like a long term happy ending.

Divorce the bitch yeah but holy hell don’t offer to pay her too you lunatic. Have a little self respect
How old are the kids?
Also, jealousy isn't a bad thing. It means you care. God is jealous for us, because he loves us. If you weren't jealous, it means you wouldn't care. Pic related.
My dilemma is, will they be better off if we divorce but my mood/drive goes way up from the release of suffering? Or stay miserable and put on a happy, fake face for them until they're grown. Not Sure I can survive that long.
have you no dignity?
But part of me knows even that would be temporary this will turn into a war.
also you shoulda left her when you caught her sending pics to that guy.
Your wife is acting very inappropriately and has lost all respect for you - the marriage cannot go on like this, you will just grow even more beta and miserable. Start laying down the law (especially if you are the breadwinner) - if she doesn't fold, be ready to divorce and rebuild your self-respect, sanity and life
Plan it out though. Talk to a lawyer before you ever talk to her about it. Dont trust her at all at this point. The ass pics is way over the line. The hanging out is way over the line. She needs to fuck off just like you said. Do everything to can. You'll be happier apart from her and so will your kids.
If she is financially dependent on you, you have the upper hand, you just have to step up. Women are terrified of losing their meal ticket - if you are one, you can make the rules of the household.

Like who the fuck does that? Stupid pea soup KEBEC mongoloids apparently
deadlifts make noise.
From putting the bar down yes, but just dropping the bar at the height of the lift is not a proper lift. You’re supposed to keep your hands on the bar.
Other guy needs to be charged with Disorderly Conduct and Assault
But that kid is still a fag
which he did. he's literally strapped his hands to the bar
in what capacity? he's off in a corner, in a designated deadlift spot, doing his own thing, The other dude is a complete mongoloid retard
at mine you can drop loaded bars from above your head and they barely make a sound
Smashing weights on the ground is for fags. He’s not a pro lifter trying to break a record. He’s some fag at the gym trying to get in shape.
/hJmVlt98FLA/;op:only
Deadlifts make noise if you're a bitch.
again, it's obvious you don't lift
Yeah, that's definitely loud, wow.
i noticed it's not a video of you deadlifting lol
I love how those guys stand with their hands out like that weight wouldn’t crush them if he collapsed
t-deadlifts 2 plate for a double
How does anyone smoke weed before lifting? I feel so much weaker after smoking anything
They're stronger than you.
i sometimes smoke just a little if I don't feel okay, but that just happens like twice a month.
The key is to not get fucking #lolblazed420faggot and to just get a humble level of high. I don't think I'm stronger when I'm high but the resistance to pain helps me push out reps. Also, my focus on proper form becomes extremely acute when I'm high.
I smoke weed everyday but doing it before lifting is stupid.
The first time I got high and listened to music while lifting it gave me retard strength and I easily btfo my squat pr. Maybe avoid the indicas that get you couch locked. Alternatively just don't smoke
t. havent smoked since yesterday night and i am planning to keep on however no fap + no weed is almost impossible to do. Already failed nofap today
One thing at a time. The first week is easy as long as you aren't a total pussy. The next two can be hard if your brain has to reregulate neurotransmitters and you feel bitchy and depressed for a while. Just be aware of how you feel and why. You'll know what to expect in 6 months.
Yeah, I don't really go to the gym baked at all, I was just extremely burnt out by the time I went to the gym last night.
Will this help with less anxiety?
Life’s about balance m8. You don’t have to stop enjoying it, just stop over doing things.
It's all placebo. If you think it will make you lift better it probably will, if you think it will duck you up it probably will. The human psyche is more powerful than the physical effects actually induced.
You know those ridiculously rich and successful people? You know what they like to do when no ones looking? Tons of hard drugs and hookers. They just balance their lives so they can afford to nearly overdose on coke and get a mild STD every few months.
You're fine. In a couple weeks, you won't even want to smoke. Get a hobby.
yeah maybe its all in my head
Stop doing that shit
Just take a 6 month break, or the whole school year, and see what it's like. Shitty people smoke to not feel shitty from not smoking. Once you've broken the habit a couple times and know every excuse, it all makes sense. I don't do it anymore, but I would if offered and have no problem not doing it again. That's where you want to be, even if you do it regularly. It becomes less regular. Unless you have a problem.
I don't do it too often anymore and a lot of successful people smoke weed, or did you mean lifters?
Same. Plus stretching out after feels incredible.
and by successful, I don't mean rappers, I mean scientists/politicians/etc
Weed is the only drug I ever took that mkes me anxious 80% of the time. Not sure if this means I have deeper issues or it's just not made for me.
Also, don't smoke cannabis, eat it or vape it. Your lung elasticity and FEV1 will greatly benefit if you refrain from smoking anything. Also, enjoy the protection from lung cancer.
Just keep on. It's psychological. The first 24 hours are when you'll think about it the most. You're already past the most difficult period. By day three you'll forget to smoke without reminders.
Carl Sagan, Bill Gates, John Kerry, Barack Obama, William Brook O'shaughnessy
Brooke*
I used to smoke a lot and then for the past year or so I slowed down quite a bit because it makes my head feel all fuzzy
I imagine you're probably a boomer that still holds that belief that cannabis is the bane of society and that absolutely nobody of status or intellect touches the stuff :^)
they dont smoke like me tho, none of them niggas is chronic
Nigga got ripped all the time.
literally nothing x2, its "clean your room bucko" tier
how can anyone think that nigger fucked with stars and shit without taking it to the dome
ok still not 5 ppl
nigger do you know how to fucking count
A youtube channel or anything?
he shouldn't lift a weight he can't control on the way down
no, the guy shouting at him silly.
Why not?
pls end urself u gigantic homo
falling for bait this hard. just ignore these people. god you faggots
i posted that first comment and you actually fell for it you faggot i was just shit posting
>roid raging faggot screaming at kid for doing deadlifts and you still side with the faggot
Fuck off to a concrete floor garage gym if you want to drop your deadlifts

look at
i dont know who i hate more. absolute fucking retards who fall for bait like this and derail my thread, or the absolute fucking cunt who baited them in the first place to start the derail. fuck yourselves

cheers mate!
He can control it, though. The problem is that he's aiming for too many reps, and his descend is suffering for it
There is no eccentric portion of a deadlift, faggot.
>2 that comment is fucking bait you cunt
Of course there is. You shouldn't let it fall. It should be controlled on the way down. You shouldn't do it slowly, of course
So many fucking people falling for bait non stop. you faggots should kill yourself. stop replying to it. you are so cringey. the baiters are making you look like retards/

I deadlift more than this kid and my 1rm I still put down more quietly
That isn't the point of the video. The guy's reaction was completely overblown
yes it was, now do we have his youtube or Instagram channel?
the other gym users complained about him multiple times and that guy just lost his temper with the twink
It was obviously distracting the other members of the gym
he walked up to him and physically assaulted him. then he escalated even more and pushed him. there is never any reason for that kind of reaction, he can get a manager if the kid is not welcome.
if you are going to be an edgy faggot irl that shit is going to happen to you
You sound like a bitch
Poor performance, indeed
yeah well, kid should have. i wondered why he didnt. but society works this way you know? its what lets it function smoothly we have official avenues for this shit. the guy was just a kid after all. not a grown man. maybe if it was two grown men i would give the deadlifter less slack for not retaliating. hes a fucking kid
Am I being trolled?
They’re both pieces of garbage desu
Either baiting or fucking stupid
retard
Lol wtf, I'll never understand people complaining about people being too loud in the gym. 90% of people already have earbuds in so it shouldn't cause an issue. I can understand if they're maybe slamming plates in isolation machines which could actually damage the machines or if they're moaning or yelling like an absolute buffoon, but especially with deadlifts? Like what do you expect? It's a gym, a place where people lift heavy ass metal plates, of course there's going to be noise.
is there science behind this statement? And is the inverse true for guys?
She's actually thicc and not fat.
Things you can change: body fat percentage
Artist here, height and proportion to head size make some people more broad in some areas. Those greek statues are 5'8" manlets. Differences in ratios between the torse and legs makes a difference, so does the size of the ribcage or hips.
5'8" was tall or at least average for the time.
some guys/girls have a smaller or wider frame when it comes to shoulders and wrists. some people store fat more easily. some people store fat in areas that arent really noticeable
but "muh genetics" isn't an argument
Its the 7 and a half head proportions. Most people are less or lanklets, especially japs even if they're tall because they have big heads. The point was that physical proportion makes all the difference. And not having a tall dude standing nearby.
if I ever see a woman like that say she is fat I will fucking smack her and say you are not fat you dumb bitch
Humans can naturally have different builds, some thicker/heavier some skinnier. You need to be able to see the difference between "thick" and "fat" though, and one can very often lead to the other if the person isn't actively watching diet/exercise at least a little.
What's been bugging you lately? Get it off your chest.
I've actually been living the life of a chad
A monster ultra on the rocks please
So /fit/ does literal /r9k/ threads now, great
Living with my parents for the summer has been awful for my mental health. Usually I’m pretty good with managing my emotions but I’ve been feeling beta as fuck recently. Don’t have too much longer until I move out though.
Maybe I'll be better after summer, I've got too much free time currently and so does she. When classes start back up, seeing her will be spaced more evenly and I'll have time to myself when she's busy with her own shit and vice versa. It's just weird, I thought that when I finally got a gf I'd do whatever it takes to make it work but it turns out I'm the one thinking of breaking it off first.
Going back to school soon? Why don't you stay moved out bro? I moved out freshman year of college and never went home. Best decision of my life.
I know that feel brah. It might just be a bump in the relationship, but sooner or later you'll have to realize if you want to keep a GF you're going to have to accept the fact that you need to prioritize her to a certain degree. That's how a healthy relationship works. Stay together for now, see if the change in schedule makes things better/worse.
Being a socially inept NEET who does nothing but watch anime and play video games. I have dug myself into a hole where I have no friends and dont know how to find a gf. Tinder is degenerate, /soc/ is just as bad and only about hook ups. I dont even know if those dating websites are valid. How does someone like me even begin to look for a gf who will someday be my wife?
Ate a whole container of this yesterday and fell asleep. Woke up having diarrhea. Can I get an ultra red sip?
I don't want to die alone but I hate playing the dating game and trying to impress people. 27 and my options are quickly boiling away but don't want to go through the long agonizing process of dating.
Being a chad isn't that hard its just something you have to do all the time
Are you being proactive and getting out of your house to be in public? No shame in not wanting to do the tinder/hook-up scene, but you won't find what you're wanting if you never try to look for it.
Would quite like gf right now. Not desperate, not incel, not horny, not even lonely. All in all quite happy, but I wonder why it is that even though I'm a great catch that I don't just have gf. How can it be that it is even possible for me not to have gf? Honestly the more I think about it the more absurd it gets.
keep fucking until something better comes along or stop because this is not as hot as i want it to be
Damn, it bugs me a lot, since my horniness has increased tenfold.
You sure don't there, bud. Everyone has a different perception of what a Chad is. I was wondering what yours was.
I mean I try to go out for walks when the sun is out. I guess maybe I should try walking around those hipster streets with all the little stores and restaurants are?
no offence but you probably arent bro
Lmao why are newfags like this always trying to prove themselves? Feels / "off your chest" type threads have existed literally for as long as /fit/ has been around
Post pics
that or if you have been improving like you said it could be that it is throwing her off that you are making such a change and she stays the same
So I've been a way for awhile and I thought I could change. I was a neet and suicidal because of it so I decided I wanted to change. Did keto, IF, and ran. Lost a considerable amount of weight and was achieving happiness. I decided I wanted a vehicle so I decided to work 2 shitty jobs till I finaly got a shitbox but I strayed from path. Now I have saved up only a grand and gained all my weight back and decided to quit one job and put my two week notice for the other. Now I have free time but do the same thing ( spleep, YouTube, fap, and 4chan) till I go to work. I feel I'm heading back to neetdom
Die in a fire
Women do the same shit and when you're young there's more freedom to explore. College is a transitional stage, and this is just the beginning. Give it 6 months and if you're still on the fence then it's probably not someone you want to spend long term with.
get the fuck out, queer
I don't know anon, she started going to the gym with me a month ago but stopped when she started working. She makes a lot of compliments about my physique and encourages me to cut further and get ripped, but that doesn't transition into a lustful feeling and confuses me.
I had an extremely rough break up last year that ruined my perception of love and relationships. It was my first love and I honestly thought we would be together forever, until I found out she was lying about almost everything. Now I have opportunities to be FWB with various girls who despise monogamy and marriage but it feels so wrong. I can smile and ignore their views for sex but at the same time I feel sick inside. Why can't I do it brehs? Even after my heart was broken and my oneitis shattered.. I can't keep living in a fairytale and thinking the right one will appear for me, this world is fucking cursed in that sense
Yesterday would have been or two years together...
pls advise
Do this and the feelings disappear over time. Time heals all wounds..
She wants to be dominated by you, show her how amazing you are.
Focus on your own life and only come to her for sex. She won't satisfy you as a friend or partner obviously, since your personalities don't mesh well outside the bed. Don't consider her as more than a fuck buddy and you'll be fine. Stick it out and see if she wants to experiment with some things you've always wanted to try if you want to keep it interesting
If you don't like her, you don't like her. fuck buddy relationships end for all kinds of reasons. if it were me i'd keep fucking her as long as i'm attracted, but just know, from experience, she will probably catch feelings for you, at which point you have to end it.
i keep pressing siri in my pocket when i low bar squat
Is it not attractive or is it a straight turn-off? There's a clear difference. It sounds like 100% you're just not attracted to her as a person, which is perfect if you're not trying to catch feelings in a fuck-buddy relationship. Who said fuck buddies are going to be ideal? Just be happy you're getting laid.
I bench 225 for reps and still no gf
>mixologists
are you lonely anon?
said, it's okay if you're not the kind of dude for one-night stands and casual sex. i'm the same way; it just doesn't feel right to me. Question though, have you actually tried getting with one of these lassies or are you outright refusing it? Sometimes getting a good sexy time in will make you feel better.
This is why you shouldn't lift for chicks.
I know that feel. Turned 27 today and feel my development is stunted. Finished my masters then spent this past year living at home and saved up a ton of money. Want to get my own place just cuz I feel like a fucking adult teenager living with my parents with no gf.
just give it time
Nice cope dishwasher
Is it a red flag?
Social media is the new currency. It's the way people are measuring value in one another today and its fucked.
I think my friends and I are parting ways
over and over because that anon is absolutely right. it's the only way I could convince myself to get over my ex. I knew she wasn't good for me but I still had feelings for her. even though I knew she was toxic to me I still let her in time and time again because I was lonely. I probably still have feelings for her to this day but you have to remember THERE IS A REASON THAT YOU BROKE IT OFF IN THE FIRST PLACE. Focus on the bad parts, anon. That sounds shitty because it is shitty...but it works.
nah i aint gay bro sorry..
lol was that supposed to be insulting? you're not even making sense and no one understands what point you're trying to prove
Ok autism
>be yourself, works for me.
I'm losing a shitton of weight but only because my teeth hurt whenever I eat.
>all you can do is the best you can do
Yesterday I brought a girl home but had whisky dick and didn't even attempt to put the condom on because I knew it'd be useless.
Start a new job tomorrow. It's a great opportunity with a decent pay rise but my last job was cushy as fuck. I'm shitting a brick desu lads as I'm concerned moving into a 'real job' is gonna get me caught out.
>inb4 degenerate
It's called grass is greener syndrome
I wanna lift, I wanna go out and have fun and flirt with other girls. I wanna have my alone time, not have to worry about doing shit on the weekends. I don't know man, it's been almost 5 months since we broke up and the lack of sex has been driving me nuts but I just don't feel comfortable with the idea of a relationship right now.
W I L L P O W E R
How can I convinced this cam thot to meet up with me?
Is their algorithm just rigged against free users?
You just outed yourself as a newfag friend
Also double check your actual gender, when 'fraping' was cool in 1946, a common one was to change the gender so Facebook referred to you as 'her' and you'd be surprised how many people never noticed/changed and appear on Tinder as a woman.
I've also been drinking every day since my gym closed down about three weeks
However, it made me realize how much I don't want to do my current job and made me lose motivation to keep at it. Been wasting time instead of being productive lately, and it's very atypical for me.
Problem is, I'm engaged and I can't get this girl out of my mind who is obviously attracted to me. I know the right thing to do, I'm not leading her on, she knows I'm engaged, but it's fucking with my mind.
Do you guys have any strategies/tipps for getting over gf?
How old are you anon? It happens, you either end up down to a handful of close friends or you end up with none. If you end up with none it won't take you long to realise it was probably for the best
Going to vegas in a week. Gonna buy the hottest escort I can find. Sure I can get free pussy but it's usually average looking birches.
I'm falling in love with someone who is already taken. Why must life curse me so?
Sounds like you want to dump your fiance desu
Everyone here complains how society is dying due to degenerates and promiscuity. How the fuck do I join that circle? I was an awkward poor kid all throughout school and every girl rejected me, and now that I got fit and make good money and want to experience and explore sex and sexuality people tell me I'm childish for wanting to act like "a kid". Fuck that, I never got to experience that. I want to experience it now.
I don't want gf for any reason other than that I just should have one right here. Why can't it be that I just post online for a gf and she sees that I'm great and comes and just sits here while I read my book?
You'll be miserable if you marry your current fiancee
Fuck, I guess I'm just one of those guys..
This happened to me. It was reciprocal but still was never going to end well. I eventually I came to recognise that she built a life with someone else and to ask her to give that up for me was just unfair. She cared for me but she cared for the other guy too and once I tried to see it from her point of view also, it made it much easier to stomach. My advice to you is accept that it will never happen and, even if it did, you'd always be 'the guy she left someone else for' and you'd always deep down be worried that you'd be the next one she left for someone else. Move on and build a life that she isn't a part of.
Find a tradgirl, marry her, raise your kids to have better moral character than you.
Welcome to life after college for ~75% of graduates
Move out if you have a decent paying job. By decent paying I mean >55k a year
How can I make this emptiness go away :(
Also, stop drinking every day. That shit's no good for you.
>got calluses and cysts on my palms
dont lie to him most college graduates get and have very high paying engineering jobs
This is exactly what I did - the year at home has been a good way to save money but has absolutely slayed my social life and general happiness. I decided to move out - I'm going to be much worse off financially but having my own place is something I really need in my life right now. I suggest going for it, life's too short and an awful lot can change in a short space of time bro.
Lmao you don't need a 55k a year job to live comfortably on your own.
There are a LOT of girls who love just fooling around, but you're trying to get your cake and eat it too with the wrong kind of women.
>complaining about living at home for only a year
I've been talking to this girl (boy) and it seems to be going well whenever we talk, but they don't reply to my messages for longer than what would be considered normal, and never initiate. Feels fucking bad bartender, real fucking bad. I thought for once I might actually find some love, what a fool, to get my hopes up.
Should I hit her up or is that just a waste of time?
I have this girl who's a bit older (35) and is jaded in terms of marriage and relationships who wants a casual thing. I think I'm going to say that I'm fine with it as long as there's no other guys involved, but the second she starts seeing someone else or wants to hook up with another guy I'm done. What do you think anons?
What do, /fit/?
Fucking bag chasing faggot
3 days of not going to the gym and i already feel all my gains vanishing into the thin air
What would you do? I'm naturally jealous i guess, but this doesn't seem like a long term happy ending.
On the bright side, I can get back to routine lifting as it's my last year and I don't really have a lot to do aside from going to some final classes and studying for my final exams.
jesus fucking christ
The nightmare never ends, friend. It never ends...
Form relationships before fucking someone to reduce the chance of fucking a psycho
Do it, see if you like it. The beauty of 21st century life is there's no shame. You can unironically fuck dudes and identify as straight in the same way I know gay dudes who use being 'gay' as a way of getting pussy as women let their guard down and think it's 'funny' to fuck a gay guy.
You have a lot bigger problems buddy
Holy fuck man that's a rough spot. I'd have left after finding out about the ass pics. Go through with the divorce for sure imo. It's better for the kids for the parents to be separated than a shitty atmosphere. Get your ducks in order, lawyer, build evidence, anything you can cause she can and will divorce rape you and take the kids. Your only chance is to build up as much against her as possible. Godspeed anon.
My gf's vag dried up
I don't see it as a problem, I like feminine features and I like penis. It's best of both worlds.
Unironic cuckoldry? Holy mother of cringe
Engineering grads make up like 5% of all college grads
Being Europoor is suffer, can i just drown sadness here with anything you like?
Seriously go ahead and kys already
Honestly, you need to sit her down and just talk to her about how you feel. If she kicks off and blames you, smash that MF divorce button. If she's willing to talk, co-operate and work on the marriage then you have potential.
neet atm, don't really wanna take up college again because as I am, i will not pass, need like a year gap to study in free time and catch up. was looking for a job for so long, finally had a shot at one but I fucked it up so they released me before the hiring process is finished.(I missed an important date). not sure what do
Sounds like she's got into your head that you're some kind of 'jealous' person. No, fuck that shit. She's a fucking filthy whore and trying to fuck with your head by telling you that. Find a girl who doesn't make you jealous.
I hope you have had a conversation with your wife regarding these issues and her point of view, along with whatever boundaries you consider as going too far (such as sending someone an ass pic, what the fuck), before taking any drastic steps.
Fucking brainlet.
i ride my bike every day hoping one day will be the day i get flattened by an 18 wheeler. why does it have to be like this
retarded unironic christfags are the worst thing that has happened to this board
Women can't be cuckolded because women can't be cuckolds. Women always know if the child is their own.
This has always been my normal route. I still always wind up with physical girls. This shit is an extra special exception becaue I knew she was crazy even before I did anything with her becaue she was telling me all of these fucked up stories from her life... but we’re eating dinner and I asked her what she wanted to do next and she answered “have an orgasm” and I said “well that’s forward but who am I to say no”. By the end of the night she was talking about how soon we would be able to move in together and got pissed when I told her to pump the fucking brakes.
Long term things could be looking up, you could meet a younger qt who loves you and is actually loyal.
anon...
Most days I'm fine with being alone with no gf but then I guess on days where my test is high it hits pretty hard, bruhs. I don't know.
Don't worry, life doesn't begin until you hit 35. If you haven't improved your situation by 35 then you're pretty fucked
If I go through with divorcing her, should I grab her phone from her when its unlocked and drive off, to save all evidence i find?
thats a lie man
That's absolutely NOT a lie. If you get all your dogs in a row by 35, you're doing better than the average person.

Gluten free bread and oats
I changed my gender on Tinder to woman and now I'm getting FTM trannies. dykes, and mentally ill girls.
Can't ask her out because I don't wanna make things awkward. Will a steroid cycle get rid of this crush? I need to to dump these stupid feels to focus on work.
It sucks now, but view it as an opportunity.
I rely on going to bars for social interaction but I'm broke and can't afford to go out. Isolation induced depression is killing me.
Low effort just like your workouts I bet
This is beautiful. Congratulations to that man.
/fit/ outdates the feels meme by years, you fucking summerfag.
i hope this isn't a lie
Or yeah, go through it one day when she won't notice. Gather evidence and dont let her know until your lawyer slides printouts in front of her nose.
im sorry i just do not believe that. if you are in your mid 20s you should already be well on your way. what do you consider having "your dogs in a row" though
Why did i started medicine, why....
another /fit/ engineer yawn
long story short i feel good. maybe its cause i feel im growing as a person or maybe its cause ive just come form the gym and im riding the endorphens.
No matter what, you need to have some real heavy conversation about why she needs attention from other guys so much. Also get some honest opinions from your friends who know the situation well.

You are 100% correct, sorry that the Shillary Fortnite playing kid is so assblasted. Probably mad his mommy wont reset the router so he can post more Blacked webms.
i dont know if i have depression or some other disorder like that, or if ive just been such a worthless loser for so long that its all that i know and that im comfortable with.
What's your degree and current job? Do you make enough to move out?
Milfy is okay, but she's manipulative even in work, so she doesn't get much sympathy
I’ve got no fucking energy lately, how do I fix it without large amount of sugar or developing a caffeine dependency?
G fuel

Better sleep, more water, less caffeine and less masturbating.
oh, how things can be so simple. /thread

ahh snatch grip behind the back press, my favourite alpha lift
Behind the head OHP is strictly worse than standard. It's for snowflake who jump onto any bandwagon lift that seems obscure. Good job outing yourself as a retarded.
they do this shit, glute bridges, some meme ab routine, that "dog pissing on fire hydrant" leg raise, squatting just the bar on the smith machine, and bicep curls into shoulder press with 5lb dumbbells. it's infuriating
Now that's a Chad.
RENT FREE
Unles you do a fucking fibonacci press, pressing from the front overloads your front delts.
Just do standard OHP with good form. Is that hard? Here's a radical idea. Do it standing. THAT'S chad.
The large occipital bone is actually a leftover from neanderthals who needed it to support their massive skulls.
Imagine fucking her while she sucks on your nuts.

Imagine being such a loser that other people's workouts infuriate you lmfao
Isn't this alongside the OHP better to do standing up? I remember reading somewhere that if you do them sitting down it will hurt your coxis. I don't know if I got memed into being uncomfortable or not.
So you're telling me that in Germany aryans are perma virgins?
I feel anon, maybe from a different perspective then him, but still the anger is real

Don’t forget leg press machine
now post a video of him squatting ;^)
>"we're gonna have our beach bodies by next week!"
Aniki?
Do you have the gif where the girl goes to snap city on the leg press
i don't have it saved as a webm or gif though
>dog pissing on fire hydrant
because this boy dumb
They're literally called fire hydrant circles do you even lift faggot?
I fucking hate these faggots that think they're cool because they can push more weight when they're doing 1/4th the ROM while pushing on their fucking knees. I'm glad he's crippled for life.

i oly lift and i love doing this lift

say goodbye to your rotator cuffs. behind the neck press only works as a push press variation

What are your /fit/ goals? What are you getting /fit/ for?
>gain some strenght since I’m weak af
I'm getting fit for BBC.

Prepping for a show
What kind of show?
Figure competition
Hey girls, let's all post our boobs pics, shall we?
Hahah yeah
Here are mine
getting that instagram girl butt so I can live off of doing nothing
Omg why don’t you go first?
I hope kegels will make it better.
Make it something realistic like biceps without face so maybe some of us will post them.
Disgusting slut
She’s married you retard
which makes it that much worse that her vagina is looser than a compton nigger's pants
Do you know what happens to a woman’s vagene after they give birth?
You should do the kegels with weights, they have a bar you shove up your vagina and attach weight on the bottom. Record it and send me the link for a form check.
Now boobs
do you think a gaping-gashed slut isn't a slut just because she's married? sluts are sluts are sluts
Are you a chick?
What about the boobs, girls?
There are no girls on /fit/ haha
some hint would be useful.
Also it doesn't help that my crush is only into girls like pic related
Double tits, I like it.
>tfw not fit enough to go in sports bra and short shorts only to get his attention
OP why do you ask some fucking dumb ass questions dude? Why are we all working out? To nut in some thot butt hole, why else would we?
I know this feel
Trannies are not allowed
Yeah, we are seeking heterosexual women, the thiccer the better.

Now that I'm fit I want a man who throws me around in bed and doesn't have mommy issues. Fit men into fit women are generally more grown up.
I pity you incel man babies.
So I can get a fit boyfriend duh. There are like no fit guys around me tho where do you find fit guys other than the gym?
Holy cringe
Get out roastie
Also hi. Some /fat/ regulars might know who I am
Are you retarded? This is a femanon thread
Why not at gym though?

also cute.
Literally a thread for us. Fuck off incel. You don't belong here.
L O N D O N

Yes it's her. She posts a lot. She was actually fat in January. She's done really well. Her mom competed in Ms Olympia(for real). She's got lucky god-tier genes
Based female boomers
no sweetie
But I am not sure if this really is femanon.
Bullshit that bench no dice
bench and ohp numbers are made up
THIS IS NOW A GYMCEL THREAD. GAMERS RISE UP!
I've caught /fit/ guys mirin' at the gym
Same with the OHP.
You have to actually lift to be considered a gymcel, otherwise you’re just an incel.
pic not rel
This is what the average /fit/ poster looks like. Jesus Christ.
Does it make you angry when other women judge you for your bad behavior?
Pic related is same person posting those stats. 99% sure she juices so those stats aren't unrealistic
>t. I was pretending
Nigga what?
If a guy approached me while I was working out it would be annoying and awkward.
My gym only has a mirror in the oly room, and it's mostly covered with curtains.
welp, guess I'm ugly
Well I know for one the Molly posts are most likely real. She posts daily. Usually in /fat/ though
blech, might as well just fuck my bf's 7inch dicklet
That’s so awkward
what were you hoping for out of that situation?
Please stop larping as a grill
This is why I’m afraid of approaching guys
oh man it's so hard having these big breasts that squirt milk all day, and this hungry hungry pussy of mine is just so much work to maintain
just a first contact and maybe a short conversation. how else do you do it in gym environment? i'm obviously a sperg
you're probably not ugly, he just didn't want to accused of being creepy
I would never strike up a conversation with a girl at the gym, especially if I thought she was just trying to get me to move my shit.
Yikes, it’s okay though it’s not like they’re gonna remember.
How hot is this guy?
Guys risk more often than woman.
sticc mode here, how do i big a big butt? i only know squats really. also, i can eat whatever i want and not gain weight but id like to be thicc
eat more than you want, then. Do bulgarian split squats and glute bridges
Glute bridges and lunges, although desu most of it is genetics.
Good way to contribute to economy
someone has to give wagecucks something to fap to so they don't blow their brains out between crypto crashes
this is good
ugly and I don't look like I lift. fml
Maybe he has gf or is into wheyfus
EU owls are the best.
It’s okay girl, give it another shot.
seen butt improvement after introducing hip thrusts, tried split squats but never sure where to focus the effort, front or back leg?
Not op but are fit guys usually into wheyfus because then I have zero chance.
Good question, when you're new to it and have trouble with balance it can feel like it works the back leg more. The key is to keep yourself upright and focus on sitting your hips back during the lift while pushing through your front heel and not having your knee go past your front toes.
pic related, I browse /hm/ occasionally
But it really depends, because when they are into wheyfus they probably won't say it anyway, it has some social stigma.
the retard crossfit guys in my gym who do their circuit training hogging all the equipment and space have wheyfus. they're super fit but it's not the mindset im going for in a man anyhow
Might as well stick to ottermode
nah most guys aren't into muscle chicks
post pic so we can judge
Or just look at this board many people here love wheyfus
maybe some decline bench presses to give my boobs a little perk
Are long distance relationships worth pursuing or should I just stick to local guys?
I do A/B compound split and I'm usually super focused but I just realized that no one has ever tried talking to me. I'm not ugly but I can't be that off-putting?
>tfw you'll never be bullied by wheyfu for being fat piece of shit
And then they want an Italian.
Want to be a posive role model for fat little sis and for diabetic dad and nudge them towards losing weight.
Using this board is not a good way to gather views about the general male population or their likes, including regular gym bros
This, this place is where the ones with weird festishes hang out
I just wanna squat lmao2pl8 for reps with good form so I can attract qts at the gym
wew lad
I remember someone posted some random college Asian girl who powerlifted and her 1rm bench was like 185 lbs but could do a 4 plate sumo DL.
nigger think about what I said, I know bitches suck at logic but you can do it. I don't give a shit if you hide and try to fit in with the way shit is normally, that's what I want you to do. but if you think you get a special little thread you're dead ass wrong. peepee>vagene
No but you women fucked up with#metoo. I won't even hug a coworker anymore.
Don't let these thots have their own thread here. Fuck off stupid vapid roasties
Only the staff talk to me so iktf ;_;
this is normal, man try not to talk to girls in the gym if they aren't leaving hints.
Calkums body is pretty good though if this dumbfuck wouldnt injure himself all the time.
talking to women like a normal human bean isn't complicated anon
L O N D O N
lol you got a serious case of fox and the grapes there bro
(pic related, its the dream body gang)
squats for thots that's why
Stop judging other women for not wanting to look like a boxy roidmonkey. You probably won't make it further than those chubby broad shouldered girls I see at my gym everyday who can't manage to do 3x20 fork putdowns
Is this just the cramps and poor sleep or is something more going on?
anything else and it's probably better not to bother
Perhaps the cramps. Mine make me have trouble feeling/coordinating stomach muscles so it's always a bit of a guess if I'm doing my situps right at the beginning of a workout, but eventually routine kicks in.
sweetie..... no
Bruuuh. i don't judge women who wants the typical istagram look. I just come from a small town where I were rarely see other girls who lift heavy.
That being said, it could also be because the body tends to get sort of sore during your period. Your back and knees hurting etc.
Degenerate: The Post
Before that hormones fuck with you while breaking down the uterus lining and getting rid of the unfertilized egg, also tender tits, fluid retention, bloating, cramps, diarrhea...
Some Girls told me I look scary and german. What did they mean?
Obviously can't speak for the entirety of the male population, but I personally dislike women with muscle, as I consider muscles a sign of masculinity and something no straight woman should have if she wants to be admired by men.

Read the post you replied to, my post you brainlet. I said this was a safe space and you replied with some bullshit about femanons hiding everywhere
I can post a pic of my menstrual cup if you want proof :)
I want to be STRONK

10/10 anon, shes the definition of perfection
C'mon, you know that should be a man's body (except for the boobs of course).
Those numbers are fraud tier
I'm a female, this is my way of coping with not fitting in to the rigid image society has carved out for me.
Nobody starts a sentence like this. Please re-evaluate your larping technique.
Normally I don't, online I do because its needed for me to make my point.
Sure, but by pointing out that you are female nobody is going to bat an eye on your point
damn anon, you right. Story of my life right there.
Why do many women tear each other down instead of lift each other up?
Same reason men do the exact same thing
*snap*

Do you know where you’re posting? We tear each other down all the fucking time. That’s why "post body" has become a thing
fake and gay

He thought you were about to accuse him of rape.
>that shoulder:hip ratio
Lots of girls who grind and work to be like the women they admire, myself included.
i want to impregnate you
any tips?
This is the average poster
low test betas are not men.


How do you respond to women who gossip, call you a whore, drag you down, and such?
All attraction lost.

huge asses are fucking nasty
Her mom legitimately competed in Ms Olympia. No it's not far-fetched if you know who this is.
Pic related.
So her mom helped her train or are you trying to insinuate god tier genetics when that's not how that works at all.
I hope so
If im checking out a girl at the gym and she notices she usually looks back and maintains eye contact for a second or two before i feel awkward and look down. Do girls stare back like this when theyre interested? I think theyre waiting for me to smile or something but i end up chickening out.
That doesn’t happen to me but then again I only stick to my friends and we’re pretty supportive of each other so it’s not like I have a chance to hear what other girls think of me.
Also love your shirt, where did you get it from?
Are tall women unattractive? What do you think of tall women? 5'10 and up
Those pseudo Yeezys tho
how about huge breasts
statistically, sure, since only fetishists will want to date women taller than them. 5'10 is about as high as I'd go (I'm 6'1)
They can be hot especially if they have a fat ass but it seems like most of them are incredibly annoying and insecure which completely kills it.
Also why is the captcha such a bitch lately
When should I text her? What should I say? When I arrive at her place am I supposed to make small talk or what? It seems like talking about her job or sth like that is a quick way to get friendzoned
Also don’t tell women you’re a virgin, if they ask lie and say you’ve had sex at least once.
Also another tip if you’re a virgin don’t jack off for a while before sex, your dick is probably too used to your own Kung fu grip. An older woman’s vagina won’t be so tight and you won’t be used to thrusting
but wont they be able to tell once it comes down to it?
Anyone run PHAT before? See any girl strength/aesthetic results?
Once it comes down to it you won’t be a virgin
my question is, will I be more muscular than now once I hit 170 again, or will I look the same?
My major mental breakdown lasted from January to like April, yet I'm still shedding like 40 hairs if I have a shower and intensely wash and massage my scalp. My hairline hasn't changed its shape but my hair density has practically halved and doesn't seem to be getting better. Top of my head has copped the worst of it but there's a lot less hair on the back and sides (if I pull back the sides I can see ungodly amounts of scalp). No one in my family is bald so I don't have the genes for MPB. I had a blood test which came back normal everywhere except for Vit D (which was way below what it should be). Am I fucked?
If it is effective you should be more muscular at 170lbs
You will be a bit more muscular
Normal, or am I going to give myself a stroke?
If I'm having shoulder pain and popping should I see my GP, an orthopedic surgeon, or a physical therapist? Or wait?
My job burns calories like crazy and I need 4000cal just to gain, can’t keep up with it.
Calm the fuck down and drink a cool glass of milk. Then go lie outside shirtless.
12 oz of your milk of choice + 8 oz of peanut butter. Drink this every morning in addition to whatever you eat now.
Fill your stomach until you feel like being sick. Eventually you'll crave the calories. I've gone from 140lbs to 200lbs at 6'4 and I'm still aiming to put on another 10lbs before cutting
I strongly suspect your GP will just refer you to a physio, so if you already have one then just go to them directly
Anyone got some ideas for breakfast while cutting. I've been eating salmon/tuna and cottage cheese on crispbread for ages and it gets fucking boring.
does it make sense to take BCAA on rest days?
Don't eat breakfast.
No, first time sex with anyone is always awkward regardless.
How do you all stay uninjured doing these low rep high weight routines that /fit/ loves? My doctor and PT says that my low volume workouts are destroying my shoulders and aren't good at all for the joints. My smaller muscles are undertrained compared to the usual muscles used in heavy compounds too.
Makes me shit my guts out.
Is it possible to build 10/10 shoulders with only barbell OHP?
Sure if you want a one way ticket to blowing your shoulders out
If I do the same number of dips a week but I gain weight weekly is it progressive overload?
Is it possible to build tolerance to lactose intolerance? I've had a whey shake for the first time and I've been farting non stop for 2 days
on my first time i banged her for 2hours and had to jack off on her tits. it was great but i was not able to get a orgasm just from sex. deathgrip kills your penis.
It is bad for me brain and body to cut at -500 or -700 tdee and also eat only 30g of fat a day? i hate cut god dammit, any help ?
/fit/ is retarded. Stretch more often, do yoga, and lift with higher reps and lower weight.
Why the fuck wouldn't you eat fat? Cut carbs instead. Also -700/day is going to be rough after a couple weeks but no pain = no gain.
Bruh what's happening to my hair
why do cameras make me feel so much smaller compared to mirrors?
Also yeah im cutting carbs to 70-80 grams
happens to me too, something to do with lenses and how they curve and distort the image.
My weightloss stalled. Could it be TRT + strenuous lifting + enough protein so I build muscle? Maybe my old foe water retention all over again? Any ideas? It's kinda annoying to do somewhat fasting, be hungry but not really losing weight.
Watch Alan thralls bulking video and follow it roughly
>Vitamin D deficiency symptoms: hair loss
Definitely eat more fat. Your body needs fats. Carbs are not necessary, especially when cutting.
im eating 150 protein, 30 fats and 95 carbs daily which are 1250 kcals, should i up fat to 35 or 40 and low carbs even more?
im 5'7 170 cm 74 kg around 18% bf
Any recommended videos I can watch on Youtube?
I don't know what the fuck you're on about with those acronyms, but you should have 1 cheat day every 2 weeks to re-boot your body
Yes, if I were you I would up my fat to 40g. 1250 kcals is also very low, maybe not "too low" for your size but if you are young and working out, you might need more than that even if you are small.
is it a bad idea to work shoulders and back on the same day?
do I lift or run first, and should there be a break between the cardio and lifts
im 31 yo, ok so ill do then 150 proteins, 40 fats and hmmm 110 carbs ? that woulb be 1400 kcal, what do you think?
What's the best rep range for weighted dips? I just started doing them every workout, three times a week. I'm shooting for 3x10 but it's pretty tiring, wondering if that amount of reps is overkill.
>does it make sense to take BCAA [...]
How do I figure out what my 1 rep max is without injuring myself?
Thanks in advance
What matters is total volume per week. How you choose to distribute the your muscle groups between workouts is irrelevant.
Lift first (while your muscles still have their glycogen stores) and run after. Taking a break in between is up to you.
You can estimate it. There’s plenty of calculators online where you enter what you can lift for how many reps and it gives you your 1rm. It’s not always representative though.
I guess what he's worried about is accidentally going past 1 rep max on something like the bench or squat.
As for training early, if you fast your performance will be decreased but it’s probably already gonna take a hit from the reduced sleep. Try eating but if it’s easier then go fasted.
I'm often tired as fuck for a day or so after lifting, am I going too hard?
I can do 2.5-3 pistol squats, with ragged form, while holding a dumbbell out to help balance. Is there a more efficient way to get to pistol squats with good form?
lol yes but you're probably growing too slow
PSMF beats the shit out of regular dieting. You feel much less hungry once you eliminate carbs entirely.
What would the difference in results be between someone who cuts at a 1000 calorie deficit and someone who also cuts at a 1000 calorie deficit and does IF as well?
IF will probably feel a little less hungry.
Nothing.
The mirror is your perspective, the one you're used to. Camera is a different, unreflected perspective
bumping the app question
I just used Notes on my phone, with a separate note for each workout and one for cardio. Whichever note is the oldest is the next workout so I cycle through them, and it updates when you update your lifts
Stop drinking Alcohol.

Maybe I have autism. Probably.

You think people go to clubs/parties and just don't talk because the music is loud? Yeah you probably do have autism.
clubs are retarded. They are designed to make you either anxious or bored. this way you by alchohol which makes them $.
I could believe this, however if you look good it is hell easy to dance/score with chicks. I don't know this from personal experience obviously
I have jungle fever, but holy fuck, this girl is ugly.

What’s exactly wrong with this?
just start dancing and then you dont even know where you are kissing some thot before even asking what her name is, not many people care about conversation its about pure SEXUAL THRILL, SEXUAL THRILL
Agreed. Haven't drank in 4 months and feel fantastic. Nothing beats being clear minded all the time. Combine with noporn and you will ascend to new levels.
I guess the negres is his gf and she was being a bitch. Which could explain why she didnt just beat the piss out of the manlet.
Yeah it is actually his Gf
Help me.
>t. Autist
>who is that guy with the camera?
True dat
The worst hangovers of my life were when I was like 18-21
The older I get the less I can drink :(
Based boomer who hasn't even peaked yet.
t. 27 year old
I hate drinking sometimes.

i'm 26 and literally hit a press PR the morning after drinking last week. stop being a pussy
Ahhh, yep, I remember being 21. Good times
>last week
Im 28 and Ive hit many PRs day after drinking. Idk, hangovers are still the same as when 18.
my dick stopped getting hard in the morning when i was 26. we're all different.
Nobody cares about your 102.5 lb OHP, faggot.
>last week
So true. It's more and more useless with every passing day.
> that 27 year old boomer that can't outdrink his liver
>falling for the alcohol Jew
Having no friends
anyone else get either of these?

Im only 18 and just started trying to get fit , could i still make it lads ?
no. you're past your prime.
0/10 bait, too obvious
You need to drink water and take some ibuprofen before bed if you decide to drink. You'll wake up hangover free.
I set several PRs the day after getting obliterated on my 21st. Does the ride end somewhere?
what do you people mean by this?
Somehow I muddle through with my disposable income.
I changed my diet and stopped getting hangovers with occasional binging. At most I have a liquid shit and light fog that disappears with a cold shower.
Enjoy your ulcer.
Haven’t had a drink in like a month, and only then because I went out for a drink w friends. Down nearly 20 pounds... of course I stopped eating fried chicken for dinner every other night... so there’s that.
just alternate a water with every drink, ez game
>being so miserable that you peak at 16
TOP MEME
lad...
Shiggy
This is only because people let themselves after their esrly 20's. Pathetic cope.
i actually peaked at 12
>needing substances to have fun with friends

learn how to drink faggot, a simple bottle of water while leaving the party/pub and another one before sleeping makes a huge difference on the other day, also eat something fat before sleeping
newfag
I guess growing up is optional whereas growing old is mandatory.
Fucking disgusting!
*tobacco
This. Quit being a manchild and learn how to drink. If you can't control your intake then you're either an alcoholic or you're about to become one. So in that case, just stop drinking entirely.
Feel fine..wtf are u guys talking about?
Like if you want to kill yourself there are better methods
College is the peak for most people because most people are failures.
i mean, you're also drinking six pints by yourself so something else has gone wrong homie
inb4 >merely pretending
Hahahababababbaha
never gotten a hangover in my life though.
LMAO found the 30 yo virgin boomer
I trully pity the average normie and their degenerate choices
Good advice, thanks Satan.
Idiotic anime poster
<the thumb
I've gotten pretty fucking smashed on occasion but I always wake up fresh as fuck
Also drink less, alcohol is a gains goblin.
There's a difference between 2-4 drinks and 5+ drinks. Binge drinking is one of the worst things you can do to yourself.
Fucking retards.
Proud of you, anon. Baby steps
What kind of drinking are we talking about? Mornings after you were drinking until passing out can be tough, yea.
if success isn't your driver then you're a loser
if you are young there is a high probability your liver is not fucked up like a guy that has partying since 15yo
>the anime poster thinks he has any ground to stand on
Mine stopped when I boosted my dairy intake. Save me /fit/. I felt for the GOMAD meme. All this estrogen is ruining my sex drive and dick.
this. but i think that was because i went way harder when i was younger.
Now that I've gotten it handled I can drink more than in my youth.
Getting drunk is a personality low and not high, it's not getting smashed and realizing that while you can get drunk as a mule in a dessert, you won't because you have responsibilities and self respect in order do your tasks that you have for the next day.
>drinking the alcohol Jew
>breathing the air jew
Amazing that even my parents don't realize all they have to do is drink one glass of water per drink and they feel fine the next morning.
Complete meme. At best it does nothing, at worst it flushes electrolytes and makes you even more hung over.
That's a six pack. Pretty much standard where I live.
you are actually retarded
haha ok guy, keep not doing it
This anon understands pharmacology.
Jopp. This is me. If i am at a party i always drink one beer after another and mix it with hard alcohol etc. Even if i told myself i won´t drink that much this evening. I just can´t stop when i start. Well, perhaps i am really an alcoholic deep inside. That´s why i stoped drinking for two weeks now and switched to non alcoholic beer like Jever Fun or Warsteiner Radler, because i really like the taste of it, but i feel much better now.
I'm 41.
just gotta get some electrolytes in you, like drink some propel or other water with electrolytes added in and a little snack before you go to sleep you should be fine when you wake up in the morning.
I AM UNSTOPPABLE
cocaine hangovers are terrible :(( (but i didn't sniffety sniff when i was 21)
27 next thursday. Yesterday I went to bed at 2pm after playing drinking WarThunder (i.e you drink a shot of vodka per tank kill). Woke up at 9, went for a 10k run at 11, feeling fantastic. You just gotta drink shitons of water before sleeping and train, god knows that being in shape translates a lot to your body being able to take shit like a good boozer
You get no hangover whatsoever the next day
That was also the last time drinking a significant amount of alcohol for me.
I don't like drinking water while I'm drinking alcohol because it makes me piss too much and costs me too much money drinking. I like to get real fucking nice and drunk. Have a Gatorade before bed and nice fat shit for breakfast while smoking a fag and wondering if I got any STDs from the previous night
>The mechanism of ibuprofen induced liver injury is not completely known, but may be multi-factorial. The rapid onset suggests a toxic metabolic byproduct, while the hypersensitivity responses that accompany the liver injury point to an immuno-allergic reaction.
Oh fuck dude you're fucking sick we should hang out
>inb4 falls for marketed memes like Mad Men
you guys make me want to puke
I feel exactly the same at 28 as I did at 21, maybe you guys should fix your diet or something? Try not to drink more than twice a week, takes the body 5 days to filter it out of the system so if you take breaks it shouldnt be as bad
The older i get, the more tolerance i develop, the more i have to drink and the less hungover i get
>drinking
For some reason i always get up earlier than usual after going out.
i am 26. you should learn to handle your booze mate dont get shitfaced and you will be fine its not that hard. faggot
I don't drink often, but last night I drank a whole bottle of wine. How will this affect my gains?
I do t get hangovers for some reason, but I never sleep whenever I drink. Maybe 1 or 2 hours. I don't know why but alcohol acts like a stimulant for me, my brain just won't shut off, even if I'm physically very tired. For that reason alone I stopped drinking. I never really cared for drinking tho, I didn't really feel that different and if a drank too much all that ends up happening is that I feel sick. I always thought people who act completely different when drunk were just faking it, but I guess I'm just too self aware to completely change when I drink.
They lasted for days
>robots are going to referee at me for being a social loser instead of an isolated one like them
I puked it all up about 20 minutes after me and her killed the bottle and felt fine
yeah you're fine in your 20's, just wait until your 30's. you wake in the cemetery with an undertaken shoveling dirt on your face whose spooked to find out your still alive, barely
nursing a single beer the whole night isn't drinking faggot, I have a buddy like you who drinks 1-2 beers and thinks he's drinking
Ive always had shitty hangovers. Even aftrr 1 beer i feel weak and drowsy as fuck. Even when i was younger.
Drank like 2/3 of a 45% bottle of Whiskey yesterday and was completly fine this morning. Probably you`re not too old just too weak.
>wake up next morning like nothing happened
That's true, but it's because you were getting absolutely fucking shitfaced.
> hitler was a meth addict
But he didn't know, his doctor said it was "vitamins".
this but I mean cmon, we probably both went as hard as we possibly could.
18-23, could go out all night drinking, wake up after 2-3 hours sleep go for a long ass walk and feel A1. 28 now, go out in the afternoon have 6 mid strength beers and food, wake up after 10 hours sleep feeling shifty and tired.
Drop and give me something.

What do you guys eat for cutting food? How do you achieve the 1g protein: pound of desired body weight goal while on a cut? Specifically, what foods are low cal-high protein?
Best way to have ground beef? Honestly tomorrow i'm going to try eating it just straight fried with some salt and pepper only and seeing how it tastes by itself.
opinion on best brand of oats?
Huh. Guess I don't do this one after all.
What foods leave you, personally, most satiated?
Favorite brand of hot sauce?
https://imgur.com/a/5nbmA
I am hoping to, in the future, get most of my protein through my diet and cut shakes totally out of my life. Do any of you do this?
OP here this is what I'm pulling from. Do any of you have something that's not here? Wanna generate some OC on recipes?
Off-topic note for those of you doing riptoe squats do you find yourself consciously shifting a little more towards your toes in order to use your quads more than your hammies?
Beef, chicken, and eggs.
Honestly should have chosen a more eye catching image for the OP but I'm lazy and just posting these in the order that they appear in the imgur post.
What blenders do you guys have? What communities do you guys go to about buying recommendations for various items in your life?
Do any of you cook ethnic dishes which are not necessarily /fit/ but taste really good?
Do any of you cook to impress your dates?
zyzz was before my time were any of you around when he was posting here? What was fit like back then?
If I started working on HD remakes or reformats of these things, would fit appropriate it? Should we start a /fit/ recipe web page?
No. I only know how to cook bland meals I eat for macros. I don't have strong taste buds and can't appreciate a well cooked meal anyway and so the blandness doesn't bother me either. That said, I wouldn't expect anyone else to share my slop.

Why do Americans put sweetcorn in chili?
This is posted in every thread. Has anybody done this? How did it turn out?
Wish i could contriboot but my computer died and i lost all the shit i had saved. But bros please tell me. Who wins between white and brown rice? What are the pros and cons of each?
always makes me laugh
I'm an American and I don't understand why anyone puts corn in chili. Maybe that's a more north/east thing, but in the southwest it's all green chili, tomatoes, beans, and beef.
And sometimes pork instead of beef.
I'd be all about it. Would be cool to have a split for cutting and bulking too.
Yeah but i only ever learn to make things i want to have and don't really have any recipes of classy food that could impress someone. I also haven't had a date in years.
It was good but I recommend really chopping those onions or you'll end up with a mouthful of onions in every bite.
Try it and find out.
Yeah, it's not the healthiest dish int he world, but like I said, it impresses the fuck out of people.
During my cut I've been eating a decent amount of greek yogurt. Whey shakes are good too. In the mornings I usually have scrambled eggs as well.
Corn is a traditional “filler” food in the US.

the phrase "nutrient paste" makes me laugh for some reason.







shakshuka
This is the most useful thread in the history of /fit/
Newfag
He is right tho
I could not afford the macro content of my shakes in solid food, have to stick to whey for the time being until I'm earning popstar wages.
When I tried it didn’t stay together in the pan so I just more or less scrambled it
Do Americans really eat oats like this? Here we just take raw oats, cover it in milk and go to town
Appropriate Browning the chicken beforehand will make this a lot better, but not necessary if you're going for a nice easy meal
Enjoy boys, you'll thank me later.
Let stand for like 10 fuckin minutes then eat with some bakery bread and butter. Eat two of those and tell me you arent feelin anabolic.
Go to the chow hall faggot
Oh boy I cannot wait to get my 3 ounces of edible meat and iceberg lettuce. Gfy.
Anyone have recipes for snacks? I want something that I can carry and eat throughout the day
Thanks bruh. I'll definitely try this out.
some anon convinced me to get a crock pot, now I need more /fit/ approved recipes
>boneless chicken breast
I'll just say if you are trying to impress always use fresh herbs and spices instead of dried ones, it makes a whole lot of difference.
So simple and easy way to cook chicken breast. If you get masterfoods all purpose seasoning it tastes a bit like kfc.
How many fucking glass bowls does this nutter have?
thank you based anon
I like it too, it seems pretty fit to me though.
I literally fell asleep in my chair posting last night guys sorry for the stop in the recipes lmao
cursed food
Update on this, for lunch I just had str8 93% lean ground beef with some black pepper, adobo and some Worcestershire sauce with a tiny bit of ketchup on the side and it was not bad at all + it was like 100g protein. Can anybody redpill me on cholesterol tho?
get them in mustard and they taste good.
Honestly any and all aversions to particular foods are mental.
>using a slapchop instead of literally just cutting your shit like a man
Do we have a uh, /fit/ discord or anything of the such? Something maybe a little faster than the board itself with private messaging? I would like to get together and make a page for recipes with some other anons but I don't have the web dev skillz.
any NYC anons swim laps for cardio n such? Where do you guys do it?
On another NYC note where do you guys go to get your fresh fish?
unironically all winter meals > all summer meals
everything in grams or dont post pls. what a ridiculous measuring system. eyeballing that some cup looks full is not accurate at all
moving to NYC in a week and seconding these questions
Some gyms have pools in nyc, tho they are usually even shorter than 25 yds so it’s really just flip turning a bunch. I think the nyac has a 25 meter pool in the basement
how tf is this a /fit/ recipe lmao
Bacon and Beese mean Brotein Brother
I'm gonna take a break and post the rest tonight.
bump for the OP
Tastes of mid-century Danish poverty, but its cheap as hell. Eat this instead of real food and you'll soon be lifting a shitton of cash that you've saved.

Do you think it broke your dick or is it just as strong?

It's 100% inbred brits
Its a tabloid not an actual newspaper.

I'm confused, thought this was a gag with weightless plates but there's no bounce.
it's that bad
>dont squat bro, just leg press instead
Oh there goes the knee!
combine the above and you get ultimate snapcity compilations

why did he lose the grip? It doesn't look like suicide grip to me.
It's just lads havin som cheeky banter
if one of us fail a rep, the other gymbros decide on what girl you hit on the next party. if you get her number you are clear. crazy things happened because of this.
At that point the weight simply flipped his thumbs outwards

She's a coalburner btw.
Actually depending on the damage they could live a patellaless life, some people just live their lifes without a patella.
Sometimes bars can have more spin than you are used it, and they feel super unsteady in your hands. The first time I encountered it was a few years ago. My bench 1RM at the time was like 260, but I could barely do a couple reps with 185 on particular bar at a gym I was visited. It's like it tries to flip out of your hand. It's weird as fuck and hard to describe.
It's called GOMAD

Your mental illness? Nah. The fake webm? Neither
Literally just a bent bar
Dont underestimate the idiocy of this shit board
cringe
If your not vomiting while deadlifting, your not deadlifting.
AHAHAHAHHAHAHA
psh, let's see her do that with both of her legs

>Sweden
the second plate always kills me lmao
Sheeeeeit i caught my foreskin doing that same exercise
not gonna make it

what in the actual fuck
now those are some KNOCKERS
Can someone explain? Did his shoulder break, then his elbow and rib cage?
For real fuck leg press, take an eternity to load the fucking plates and can fuck you up real bad. Do front squat instead
That means people vomit while doing that all the time. Wtf
What the fuck is with this new retarded trend? Suddenly every instagram thot who does some retarded smith machine squats is now a "certified" fitness "coach" and they offer their retarded ass programs that people eat up like fucking candy. I know this shit has always existed at gyms with dumbass PTs that don't know shit, but it's so fucking amazing how this seems to have exploded recently. You don't even need to know how to really lift, just do a bunch of stupid machine exercises and after a few months you'll have an ass to die for and you can start "coaching" retards online
Nothing wrong with making money off of retards, I’ve been thinking about getting my pt cert for a while
Don't be a hypocrite. You know you could be a coach after several months of lifting.
wish i had a company offering the shitty "qualifications" they pay for the nose for, must be a quick way to get minted these days
I think the shits wouldnt have enough material to be solid tho idk.

starting hrt to transition socially to female. since i am apparently the only tranny in the world that squats i have a pretty gud figger.
Girls at first, then I quickly realized that charisma, fashion and face is about 100 times more important in that regard. After that it has been more of a means to build a body I feel good in mixed with narcissim.
Just to feel lighter and stop sweating.

Keep going dude, you'll make it. How do you deal with lose skin? In the same shape and afraid I'll look like a granny once weight is lost.

Lifting has given me meaning, helped motivate me in all areas of life and made me a lot more positive due to liking myself a lot more now.

Depression
Yes, sure does. Great place to bury yourself in negative shit, being edgy and whine about life not going the way you want it to. Shit place to build any type of character that takes you to where you want to be.

I started solely because I was tired of being a weak cunt. As time went on and real life started shitting on me I started appreciating how well it helped me work through my problems, too.

Self disgust and an inferiority complex
Any tips to avoid it /fit/?
I ate the rest of the cookies on the bus but was so angry at home, that I started swimming the next day
I noticed it was mostly bullshit, but sometimes it was true. I decided that I'm not doing this shit when I'm 40, so I better get crackalacking so I don't turn into some excuse-laden fat slob and get trapped there and live out that pathetic existence. So, uh, injury prevention.
Good luck on your journey brah

This. Although I think he'd be the only survivor in that collision
I lift to be a model uncle that will inspire his nephew/niece to lift and be healty like me. I also want to be able to play with them and do sports and stuff.
Because when Lenin comes back from the dead and reclaims the world revolution from the faggots currently parading it's dead corpse around I want to be ready for the call to arms.
you made it
Just to answer to a meme thread.

Regain your dignity
It's kind of weird thinking about these things.
same as this guy
Having a shit life. Getting fit worked.
need a girl like that in my life

not the reason I started lifting but im also looking forward to showing my nephew the basics when he's older. He's only 9 now but seems pretty intrigued when he's seen me lifting and shit which is pretty cool.
Crippling depression and getting stuck in my head with my neurotic hell. I don't think when I'm lifting-a blessing.
Since that shit I haven't missed many gym days
Communism was a lie. An excuse for Jews to kill the Tzar and take over a foreign country. It was never about actually reaching communism. Karl Marx is related to the Rothchild banking family. He never actually cared about the workers or about fighting the big capitalists. He was allied with them.
The look on their face when I tell them it's K-On! usually gets me kekking.
I'd like a grill like that in my life, too.
In high school I loved one girl for four years, since I looked at her and talked to her at start of HS I loved her. She was completely average looks-wise, but she was actually intelligent, by which I mean man-inteligent where you could hold conversation about deep shit with her, not inteligent like stupid college hoes. What truly caught my eyes, was that I never saw her using smartphone, but with good book in hand in her free time. She had boyfriend, who I was friends with, so I were just a friend. After years they broke up and before I got the balls to ask her out she got with your typical dumb as fuck alpha male jock. This broke me, becouse she was the only girl I ever felt connection with. Started hating women and started treating them like shit, they started me treating better. Started lifting so if ever some fucking stupid bitch lashes out at me and attacks me physically, I'll fuck her caked up face as much as possible in one punch.

citation needed
The hours during and after my workout are the only moments of my life that feel meaningful. It's sad really, but hey, better than drugs.
I'm sick of being sick. I must be healthy.
Spent a few years watching my formerly fit dad dying slowly after letting himself go and decided that I don’t want to die like that too. Pretty simple really
If I wanted a girl like that, I needed to get myself in shape. And it worked.

I read Revolt Against the Modern world and now I lift for Hercules.
last girl I hooked up with was a bit out of shape and I realized I was teetering on the brink myself so I figured I'd at least make the effort to save myself from general mediocrity
the walk back from the beach in wet swim trunks chaffed me up. Hated that shit and lost 20 pounds and now I dont chaffe.
I realized i was stupid and concluded lifting heavy things over and over was the way to improve myself
Are there any low impact forms of cardio which can be done for free or at very little cost (no gym memberships, expensive equipment, etc.)?
doing calisthenics
Walk or take a jog. Its free
also jumping rope with good form, it does have some impact but not as much as running.
>Dumb question
>Fruitarianism
the semen-only diet
Veganism cuz animals and health
i pick none of those, because there are better alternatives
But if you only had the choice of those four dumdum

after stopping keto over a year ago my appetite has seriously dropped to almost nothing and its just easier to eat once a day. also eating carbs hit me really hard now, so hard that i get dead tired half hour after eating just a muffin
also the best unironic diet to follow is keto+paleo+non mass produced dairy
yea sounds healthy there brah, top notch gut bacteria you gained on that diet (y)
Keto has a little more wiggle room for carbs, plus plants like avocados and nuts and such. From what I’ve seen people are doing zero carb with all meat, eggs, and oil. Not even dairy is consumed with zero carb.

The happiest time in my life was last year when I deleted all my porn, stopped fapping for 2 months, and worked out all the time. I will strive for that again. I dont know if it will help, but it couldnt hurt. Thx anon
Give it time and you will end up with traps and shit. It's because the attractiveness of porn is intertwined with the craving for novelty. Nofap cured me of all of this.
let's keep the /pol/shit out of nofap
Just ignore and report it. Mods are on our side.
why? scared of the truth? fucking coward
cartoonishly they avoid truth at any cost.
But guess what faggot, sex sells. If not the Jews it'll be capitalists running porn. just so happens jews are a thrifty and business-wise culture. there's no fucking world order behind it
Also, I see a lot of people blaming the jews for this. I'm not a /pol/tard, and I'm not afraid of the jews, but are they saying this some big conspiracy to lower birthrates?
If testosterone levels peak after a week of abstaining from ejaculation, why not just fap/have sex0rz once a week?
Sometimes I think you just need someone to blame in order to make it seem like you are fighting against anything other than your own willpower. It's way easier to fight against someone else than it is yourself.
Fuck off nigger kike
Nice subtle attempt to push faggotry and transexualism on the unaware.
Ultimately you are responsible for your own actions, blaming the jews for this is pathetic.
Are you guys serious? I've been fapping to hentai and porn since I was 14 and I still have no interest in traps or any gay shit. I'm 29 now, I think that's a personality thing. Kinda like how some people can smoke weed occasionally but others get addicted even though it isn't supposed to be addictive.
This is like thinking rich people are successful cuz they planned it out. (((They))) are successful for the exact same reason whites advanced faster than other races. Luck and exploiting that luck just like bill gates and Zuckerberg.
You're just like leftist and the word nazi. Constantly moving the goalposts for what's considered degenerate, and giving free passes to Trumpy
Mostly
Mostly Hollywood though.
Obviously Hollywood is degenerate, it promotes drugs, adultery and fosters grown children like yourself who wont connect dots. The industry is dominated by (((people))). You should go back.
Trump has repented
They are just selling what the audience wants. You gotta solve the idiot normie problem for this to change.
Who let Dan Schneider in here
The idiot normie is not in control, the people who own all the media outlets are. To change this you need to expose the agenda they are pushing which is to enslave the western world and the white race in particular. Then you need to replace it with an opposing healthy system of propaganda.
There is no physical or mental reason a normies can't inform themselves. They just don't want to. You are on fit, even if you don't lift weights, you are attempting to better yourself with cutting edge info on a Mongolian weave board. If everyone was like you (((they))) would have no influence. Unless you buy everything you see in ads.
All of us here on fit should embrace the empowering memes and become these teachers.
I here you, yes people need mentors but most of us here self study with books and YouTube. You cant tell me that school wasn't a majority of a waste of time.
I agree. School should focus on building character, strength (both mental and physical) and needed knowledge (not dates and names). It should also build a community between people not competition.
My work is done for the week trying to give back to the community. Hopefully this shit doesn't get deleted in 5 minutes. Good luck, MEN.
They are about indoctrinating you and making you into good slaves and breaking your ability and want to think and learn.
are there more hackbooks I should know about?
instead of meditating like some eastern buddhist sam harris faggot, pray the Rosary

Quieting the thoughts of my mind for 20mins in the morning has proven to be helpful for my sustained mental balance and focus.
dude was a hack and a con. They should let goerge cloony do him in a movie. Like, he was an insane crazy con. You should google the real story, its amazing.
I just need some real proof. Not a shitty infograph from 4chan talking about my ancestors with a picture of some ancient Greek statue lol
>implying w/out evidence
jew shill
Why can't I just get some facts w/out the Nazi crap or some lecture about my ancestors and how much they suffered? It makes you look like you're trying to guilt trip people into this with "muh ancestors". Just show something real. I'm not saying that the evidence doesn't exist, but if it does exist, it's never posted. If nofap is good and healthy, why does it have to be connected to NatSoc? Why can't it just be a healthy thing that anyone can do? It just makes no sense.
Just do what you like best and do it every day.

That's not Christian, fuck off
Day 98 of nofap. Right now it's fucking 4:24 in the fucking morning and I can't fall asleep of the constant barrage of horniness. I don't like this timeline lads. Help.
I decided to go into nofap yesterday because sexual fantasies started impacting a fresh relationship I'm developing with a really sweet girl. She's submissive in bed, so I'd let my urges free and subconsciously try to take control even outside of bed. It did not work well. We're going to abstain from sex for some time and I want to complete it by not masturbating at all. I owe it to her and to myself to be able to fully appreciate what we have and can have, with a clear mind, without the fog of fucked up fantasies and sexual tension.

Nice sources, OP. Surely that scientific evidence stands the test of time
One thing is for sure, if modern society has to improve, it has to take its faith off modern sexual sciences and go back in time. Modern science as it relates to sexuality is no longer credible, pic related.

Haha, you really believe you'll get super powers if you don't jerk your dick?
Pic related. It's the unhealthy, vicious, inevitable result of the NoFapper after failing for the nth time.
Yep trying to have self discipline to nofap is stupid. If it's a placebo, doesn't that mean it works if you believe it does?
I get pussy too idgaf about no gap do it if you want
There's nothing retarded about them
Jerking to Pixels On A Screen Is Cuck Behavior, Period.
I hate it. I think it's the sluttiness more than anything that gets me off. Those fags love dick like no girl can.
I found out about nofap and first tried it at 19 and im only taking it seriously now at 23. So many wasted years man...fuck
I'm 8 days in and I'm waiting for that power
Thats a satire site to make fun of Christians
The self esteem boost is probably the most noticable benefit, atleast this far in. How can you feel inferior to other men when they do that degenerate shit and are slaves to their desires and you arent?
>Implying pornstars don't escort
>Oh well I guess you /pol/tards consider the whole movie industry "degenerate" too
How many buildings you sold, you dick tweaking faggot
Jesus Christ you’re not even trying to be subtle.
I hit a huge streak of 27 days back in April, then I've had spotty success. Let other people make me believe no fap was a meme, and that no porn was what did everything. Came here on day 4 no fap no porn, horny and trying not to break while I lay in bed. This was some excellent motivation to hit a better streak. Honestly, just looking back to that streak is good motivation. I had much more energy, was happier, more confident and assertive. Wish me luck, boys
Jews dont have to work hard. They can just work smart and get similar or better results. They also care less about American morals and will use Jewish tricks to get what they want. Which is another form of intelligence.
what app is this
Quitzilla
I fap because it feels good. I'm confident, have a gf, and a career. I didn't need to stop touching myself to get these things. Stop with this self-righteous, holier than thou BS
sounds a lot like you could just take zinc supplement and keep beating it, and you would come out the same
If you stop masturbating you gain powers more potent than any man can ever have
I'm saying it's like dropping coffee for a while. Coffee has plenty benefits but do you want to use it as a crutch. You are on fit so you can understand the desire to improve even if there is no proven scientific evidence. It's to make sure you are in control of the fapping and not the fap controlling you.
Nigger, congrats on accomplishing the base level of success that everyone else fucking does to survive. I'm not an unemployed incel. This is about improvement, not 'good enough'. I'm spreading advice to people that want to improve, you don't have to argue FOR something that EVERYONE already does.
This is what you morons believe
Did you skip everything but the part where he talks about zinc?
Even if you can find a post or two from some idiot, does that invalidate the other 99.99% of people? I guess you're a moron who believes that the earth is flat, given that you're a human. That's what you human morons believe.
Hahahaha
oh man its a conspiracy!
not one of the brightest ones it seems.
t. does not actually science
Just think about that for a second.
Any sources for when I'm tempted to watch porn?
reminder of who is afraid to even consider not jacking off
>still no gf
Jokes on you faggot I have a gf and I fap whenever I want to cause I'm 21 and it's a more productive way to deal with raging hormones than self loathing or blue balling.
>inb4 beating off to paper is the new argument
Not /pol/, but film and television was a mistake and all the best works of visual media could have easily been great novels.
Noporn is easier if you fap without porn. Nofap doesn't make sense to me, your body don't know if you have sex or fap
It does though, an orgasm from sex releases oxytocin which is absent from an orgasm from masturbation, also the prolactin levels are x4 higher
But I mean, if you think flapping does something bad to you, why doesn't Sex do the same thing?
>this much pseudoscience
It's a fucking fact you moron
How does the brain even differentiate? Does it divine it by magic?
I brainwash myself with this all the time
Because you have eyes
You know how you can't tickle yourself? Another person touching you is significant. And there are probably pheromones and shiiet
So if you have sex with lights up, its basically masturbation?
Lift for Jesus.
>tfw all Christians are philosemitic cucks who eventually bow down to every single (((liberal))) cause, and kiss the feet of apostates
Are you that much of a downie that you can't differentiate between having sex and wanking? Pro tip, if you know then your brain also knows
Currently reading a book called "Virile Powers of Superb Manhood" by Bernarr Macfadden written in 1900. I mean I'm into nofap but didn't expect to get much out of the book, that said it's surprising how much this nigga got right for that period. He was advising against eating white bread. How erection is linked to cardiovascular health and a few other things that don't come to mind yet.
What is the argument for nofap when the intended target is the group of teenage virgins focusing their lives on education? You don't have an opportunity to start a family of find a partner until you're at least in your mid 20s or 30s.
Do you have an academically peer reviewed source to back these claims up? I never see people provide an actual source when talking about possible negatives of fapping.
Less so than non-Christians. Trad Catholics are basically anti-progressivism

Pathetic waste of oxygen
I live in the Eastern side of Warsaw. I'd have to move back to Chicago for the next few years to complete any sort of education. Most of my time socializing was spent here. The last time I was in Chicago was 2011. I have become quite comfortable here, but healthcare and education is hard to come by here. I doubt I would be able to socialize in such a place like Chicago due to cultural differences.

Hows Poland besides the lack of education?
T. 80IQ LEFTY
Help I just started touching my dick and opened a new window for porn, then came to close this one and see this thread open. I've been strong and 6 days in now (but had a wet dream last night) but I'm so close to relapse.
I'm never going back!

Yea let them keep staying in bluepill bliss. I wouldn't even tell them to meditate or take cold showers either.
If you count that as my birthplace being Chicago, then technically. Otherwise the family is Polish, and the family before that was German. Besides the at times sparse education centers that take long to get to, and the underwhelming medical care at times, it's liveable. You can be in the more rural areas or towns quite comfortably. Food Choice is also healthy. I'm concerned with going back to the US because everything seems to contain onions to some degree.
Good for you. The point of NoFap is to get involved with real life. That includes partners. You're on easy mode going through this, the virgins don't.
I don't trust any of you because you're a bunch of lying niggers but I'm going to go jack off right now and then I will start my run just to see If I actually feel any difference, wish me luck
Its also to keep your vices in check. Even without the science how is this any different from dropping sugar, coffee, video games. All of those things have benefits too. Oh, I know because they are owned by fapping even if they do it sparingly.
>t. Barely graduated high school
Case in pointpoin
I don't agree on the indoctrination because you have to believe in something for it to affect you. But it does kill children's drive to learn. Unless you took advanced classes like I did. *humble brag
Are there any underages that actually do this? I didn't discover fapping until I was like 14, didn't really delve into it until a few years later, so I'm curious how the youngsters have it in these years.
Absolutely based and redpilled, bro
I'm 27 and I've been masturbating since 11 or 12.
Trusting some alcoholic Finmongols 'research'
Literally nothing he said is verifiable through scientific study. The test boost does not cycle, androgen concentration does not cycle. Keep coping
I'm 10 days in and my sex drive has died
I wish all of you retarded /pol/niggers, virgins and autists would just fuck off where you came from, none of you even fucking lift, youre just here to validate your fucked up life decisions and feel better about being an outcast
>Quitting Heroin is like an anti-thesis to /fit/, instead of being proud of something you actively do and improve yourself with, like lifting or studying, you're being proud of literally not doing anything, passivity.
Playing vidya games all day is the point of fit. You can be proud to play vidya its an accomplishment. How is passivity bad? Meditation, sleep, relaxation, and recovering are all passive but how is that bad? Enlighten me.
This argument is retarded in the first place because jerking off takes a few minutes, maybe half an hour. People on this board are lifeless faggots, they aren't busy studying 8 hours a day and working out, they don't need to optimize their life in a way that they use every minute properly.

The first thing nofappers tell people to do is meditate and lift weights. What are you saying /fitizen/? The funny thing is you can't do nofap if you don't do those things you said(optimize life). You will relapse in 3 days.
...oh wait
You don't need no-fap to go to the gym or medidate, these 3 things have absolutely nothing to do each other. These people are all 2016 election refugee newfags who probably never lifted a single weight in their life.
fuck off kikes
I agree with you about them being refugee newfags but that's why nofap and sig try to stay apolitcal.
Then your picture should be reversed. The joouse are the chosen superior race. They are doing you guys a favor by ruling you. If (((they))) really are doing all the things you claim why wouldn't you submit to the superior race like you want minorities and women to do for you?
And because of all the retarded /pol/niggers, the average poster isn't even more /fit/ than the average person anymore
It's true, I was a healthy, attractive chad but then I got laid so much I became weak and feminine. Oh wait that doesn't happen. I can lift, pull, and bike every day and spend time with the girls and work on my projects and still get off just fine. I'm going to remain a virgin for the next decade or so as I study, so what else would I do?
I meant old fit. /good fit/. I agree most /pol/tards are conservative and racist in reaction to other sources. They didn't internally come to that conclusion to be conservative themselves. They are like the liberals they claim they are better than. I meant a normal /anon/ coming to fit for self improvement is better than a normies who reads or sports magazine or listens to his fat dad. If you follow the threads we use cutting edge info to improve ourselves. Alot of its unproven but anecdotal. A normal personal would dismiss fasting and just listen mainstream info about how only 2% people can lose weight and keep it off. We on fit know thats wrong because the studies themselves are faulty. But even without that we can look at our own lives and recall people who have lost the weight and kept it.
Do not have casual sex
o.6998/
Casual sex for me is mostly being an animal. Fucking hard and giving the comments. Women loves this and so do I
Extra: It feels like I conquered something, like I win a match in kickboxing
But it just didnt feel right, idk man.
From this day on I will do nofap for a while and see what happens. I might fap rarely, but I will avoid porn, which I have been addicted to since my teens.
Good luck man, make sure to stick to it. It brings huge change.
Because you're not broken inside, like the guy you're responding to.
lol and be all tense and horny constantly? I've gone on 30-90 day streaks in the past, and even though it gave me some fluctuating levels of assertiveness and "alpha traits", it just got too much man. I was frustrated, found it hard to chill with friends etc. My life is way better now with sex every 3-4 days and the occasional fap if I haven't gotten any. It's about balance man
The amount of cope in this thread is alarming. Rationalizing jerking off like a junkie rationalizes one last hit. Wasting your seed to 2D pixels is always going to be a negative force in your life any which way you look at it. Everything in this life has a price.
t. fapping virgin
OH NO OH NO OH NO
Is this something like women studies?
tldr: fap in moderation and without porn.
At least you recognize porn is absolutely detrimental for health. That's a start.

me in the back exposing my left nipple
there's only that much zinc the body can absorb
just masturbated to sissy porn for the last time lets fucking go
Are camgirls classified as porn? Please say no.
The only women not considered porn are girls you have actually met and are likely to see again in the near future
Are you sure thats the last porn you ever want to see?
Flatline. Enjoy it. Don't worry about your "sex drive dieing forever". Doesn't happen to anyone. Your sex drive will still be there, stronger than ever.
That's my contribution for the week. Good luck, faggots. It's your choice to decide who to believe.
if it's not in person, yes
Bros I haven't fapped in one month and have looked at close to zero nudes online. As a result, my dick has been literally dripping precum but I do feel like my social anxiety has subsided though. Worth it I would say.
Sublimate. Hit meditation or prayer for a 5-20 mins at least per day, so you're not so close to being triggered.
Found the Jew.

>if *he* will stop taking steroids his muscles will deflate and he will be left with loose skin
On the other side of the spectrum, I think are gymnasts and circus acrobats, who easily transfer their skills and strength to every new thing they try.
>But I don't want to get too big.
OH WOW! SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT, LIKE, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PRACTICE SOMETHING TO BE EFFICIENT AT IT? HOLY MOLY! I WOULD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT!
It really is funny that some people say they don't want to get too big when they barely lift.
Nothing is hotter than a girl with broad shoulders
fasting will screw up your body and metabolism. You need to eat three times a day. You need to keep your blood sugar up
A woman with narrow shoulders.
curb your basedness
yeah and gymnastic and circus training incorporates most of this practice you mentioned, while SS and SL incorporates next to 0 movement variation.
>"You too."
you don't get dizzy and light headed if you skip a meal?
AAAA ARE YOU BLIND IM FUCKING SHORT AS FUCK.
have you ever noticed that literally every athlete trains in the gym besides practicing his sport you faggot? That means going to the gym and training your body already makes you 50% more efficient than someone who never trained anything if you both choose to practice particular sport
>breakfast is the most important meal of the day
But it's true. Water will kill you.
>I'm happy
"I don't run on a treadmill anymore because my arms got too big."

Yeah if you try to breathe it.
On my way into work I had to stop into the gas station for coffee and candy because my blood sugar was low.
hey good for you man
>fruit has natural sugar that is good for you unlike the sugar in candy and soda
>I think I'm ready to move on. I don't love you anymore.
This is true tho you would know that if youever performed any physical activity.
>comparing yourself to people who don't even lift
>not doing dips on your treadmill while you run
what fucking country?
Is it different for roidheads?
This is true, though.
it's not verbatim
farmer strength is massively different
Australian here. I've heard that quite a few times.
Anyone not doing significant cardio drinking gatorade is just consuming carbs they haven't burnt.
No it's not. The idea that it's true was invented by the marketing departments of cereal companies.
They're always fucking skinny guys.
>he doesnt drink powerade zero
Maintaining optimal PH levels is important and the use of hydrolyte (sugar+salt+H20) is an effective way of achieving this
It’s true though, but you need to drink Insane amounts of water.
>Burgers help you shit
>muh functional strength
i don't know if you are the faggot who was defending normies but im replying to the FAGGOT who is comparing average gym rats to experienced athletets saying that lifting in the gym won't give you specific muscle coordination required in given sport, NO FUCKING SHIT SHERLOCK
I doubt Kellogs marketingnoffice existed back then.
yeah but he could chop wood better than you faggot
cool dude would help if you picked up a weight here and there you know
>consumes 3000 calories of fast food/junk food/ desserts
not really, but it was because he was skeleton
once you notice it, you dont stop noticing it
good times
a lot of amateur climbers/gymnasts/street workout guys/ dancers/etc etc. I am comparing gym rats to that
>It's not
Sure, people may have been eating breakfast before then, but the point is that it doesn't matter that much when you eat as long as you are getting enough calories and hitting your macros.
I often drink some sugar after hard cardio sessions, cause I perform better the day after.
stay dyel
what is your fucking point?
you mean that he 1RM 80kg in ohp @ 70kg bodyweight? That's not even impressive
bro im gonna hit this tyre with a sledgehammer too!!!!
They then blamed it on steroids while I'm fucking natty lmaooooooooo normies are so delusional and retarded how does a show muscle even work, muscle fiber is muscle figer bunch of retards
are you a 15 year old girl?
you actually shouldn't do this. it doesn't just suck all the nutrients out like people think but it will lower their concentration and you will just piss it out in no time.
gym rats can benefit a lot from trying new stuff, instead of being complacent with their lifts
>tfw cucked by sparky thunderknot
I had no sex so far and I'm alive, I can wait a bit more.
benefit what? getting injured from doing stupid shit and not being able to perform safe exercies that grant you actual benefits?
it feels good to learn new stuff and to move in a variety of ways
I mean, it was +- 120kg. I could've push pressed that shit.
The other guy will be more efficiently using his muscle and energy though
I don't have farmers strength, I'm a gym meme, but overall I'd prefer farmer strength. Work all day cardio, enough strength to do whatevers necessary, and learning skills as you go.
yeah absolutely, also bodybuilding is retarded
100% correct
not that guy. labouring doesn't do much for cardio unless you do things quite fast which is discouraged cos you get too tired and might injure yourself. it is just loads of reps at low weight, walking with it and carrying the odd heavy thing. i did it for a bit, lost a bit of fat, gained a bit of muscle and strength but then at my judo session i was knackered and breathing out of my arse in no time
My reply: wanna fug?
it does a lot for cardio my man. gym session is 1 hour, farming is 8 hours.
but thats what im saying you never go too intense. your never out of breath unless you are like me and push it occasionally cos i like to do that and it is actively discouraged in a work environment. its all stress on your muscles not your cardiovascular system. in the gym i will be breath less and on the verge of being sick most sessions.
But what is farmer strength? Just the fact that you can manage what you have to do and no more? How is that different from office strenght? Or toddler strength? Do you think that a farmer is stronger than a bodybuilder who squats 5x more? Do you think that bodybuilders don't have stamina to work all day? Most of them have an excelent cardiovascular system, and most of them have skills and learn more skills over the years.
My boss has never discouraged me from working hard/fast
Eat something. Problem solved
You misspelled guy
well, duh. eating nothing but carbs for breakfast is obviously bad, specially simple carbs - but it's a great time to get your fat and some proteins in.
because they need calories and vitamins so they dont literally die from burning 10k calories on ultra marathons
Not at all. Microbes still have nutrients. If you really want to get fit, develope a tqste for matured clabbered milk for more iron and brotien.
why do normies think jogging does anything?
Yes they do not have the stamnia to either do a gym session for 8 hours or work the farm for 8 hours, in almost all cases their cardiovascular endurance is not strong enough
>Yeah I'm pretty strong u'now, I can lift this many kg in this specific fashion
Kinda true, considering most people in the gym are doing brosplits with very little to no compound lifts.
yep i was gonna type that but didn't. don't know why, it doesn't have to be much either
Isn't it 6 liters or something insane that kills you

> thought he was athletic because he was the waterboy for the football team
If you’re out of breath regularly, at a construction job you’ve been doing for a while, there’s an issue. Are you fat? That may be causing you the breathing hard issues. Normally you shouldn’t be panting for breath on a regular basis at construction.
faggot
With this weather I easily drink 6 liters a day (heck when drinking alcohol I can easily hit 6 liters of fluids a day)
fuck you
Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
A marathon runner is in constant motion during a marathon. If you are trying to compare daily construction work to running a marathon, that’s a stupid comparison. Are you mad cause I guessed right on you being fat?
mate i am talking from experience. I've done many types of hard jobs and sports/gym sessions. you do get used to it and if you don't then something is wrong. no two ways about it. do you smoke? whats your diet like? cos that is not good or normal. yes you might get a little tired but you shouldn't be literally out of breath on a daily basis after getting used to it
Normies have LITERALLY no idea how diet works
t. packed stuff on a forklift once and decided they were working manual labour
You can actually look up the LD50 for water. I was surprised it was that low. But it all comes from how quickly you drink the water, how much salt you eat and stuff that generally influences osmotic gradient in your body. There is probably a bunch of shit that can cause hyponatremia.
T. Delusional fatty
The point is gym is less respectable because you grow muscles 100% for cosmetic reasons instead of actually using them for a specific thing that requires it. That's why no one gives a shit about body-builders but people admire people who have great athletic abilities. You can lift withtout being delusional
I need to hit 3pl8 so badly.

Maybe YOU do, but plenty of people do it for other reasons as well.
Lad...
its called BODYBUILDING for fucks sake. why would you even try to pretend its not for shallow reasons?
>not using the gym as while doing a sport
Unless they're competing they're not bodybuilders, just people who lift weights. If you think people only lift weights to look better you're delusional.
so what are the other reasons for lifting?
Strength? Health? You don't even need a reason. Maybe someone does it just because they like how it feels.
In case you are still living under a rock let me explain to you: it's all about looks, not function. No one gives a shit if you can lift X amount of weight or run X miles in X amount of time. People care only about looking good. It looks like you're the one of those faggots who look like shit and get butthurt every time that when someone else compliments other guy on his looks and no one compliments you on your irrevelant lifts/performance/etc. You are literally Jason Blaha.
cry more
yeah youre the textbook shallow faggot i was talking about, thanks for confirming
says the dyel guy with zero respect from anyone, you really hurt my feelings pal, you better apologize

what does holohoax mean?
It means that /pol/ was right again
someone post that gif from the simpsons where the dogs are fighting until their chains are broken
many sports dont even require being "big", look at bmx or skate, its 110 lbs dudes doing things if you tried you would most likely die or end up in an armchair your entire life.
>if you do [verb] it will activate the [noun]
This. It only really applies when overdosing on water.
In the military if you live in the desert they recommend eating the salt packets in MRE's because if you drink too much water to combat heat without getting enough salt you will go down.
How do you OD on water
i guarantee you will not overdose on water you dip. Even 4L is too small of an amount
guess what faggot, i was riding bmx seriously unlike your sissy faggot ass who "tried". I broke my elbow, snapped my ankle and broke my back. I quit after breaking my back because this shit is not worth being in a wheelchair. When i was riding the only people who showed respect/admiration were only the guys i was riding with. Since i started lifting i get mires literally from everybody around no matter where i go. When you are big and look strong no one will ask you if you are strong. They will assume you are (and they are right)
you had it at some point
Sure, they may be stronger than the average person, but not as strong as they could be.
er_intoxication
also, cope harder fat fuck. Just because you're too lazy it doesn't mean that everyone is. Just look at Larry Wheels. He is super lean and he is literally the strongest guy around. I bet you are stronger than him because you've got that sagging gut of strength, right?
but this is objectively false
burns calories?
this is not about paying checkers you fucking retard
Dis why i don't talk to normies.
I didn't say you can't be strong and aesthetic, you muppet. I said that you won't be that strong if you lift solely for aesthetics.
What's her stage name?
Calm down people. If you get angry online, you've already lost it. Time to take a break.
"I/Women like normal guys with normal bodies, not roided freaks."
She was busy getting fucked by a dog
Women want soiboys they can easily control, while they fuck chads
>he still thinks cardio burns calories
The only ones I can think of where it might be not helpful or massively advantageous would be soccer or cross country, and I’m not even sure about that.
Have you seen the legs on football players
you gotta drink like 30-40 cups of water to do that.
Do you even drink water?
I said I’m not sure, I do think most pros do it, I’m just not sure how much on the sport
wow, the cope on this one. you're just fuckin weak mate
As long as you are eating food this is a non issue. You couldnt drink enough distilled water to flush minerals at the rate they would be replaced by consuming food, if you were fasting and only drinking distilled water then you might have an issue eventually but otherwise no.
adding salt to water makes it boil at a higher temperature and freeze at a lower one so fair enough but it isn't hard to eat a lot. also a pump will make one appear larger after just one workout
thats because you are sweating the salt out not cos you are drinking too much water
drink a lot of it how do you think?
How much is a lot
gym rats who are big but just go to the gym who come into martial arts, gymnastics, climbing and swimming are fucking useless. martial arts: loads of strength but don't know how to use it in any way but pick up a heavy thing designed specifically to be picked up and no coordination so its easy to use that strength against them, also not much balance. gymnastics: poor flexibility, balance, power and agility so suck at most of it.climbing: lots of strength but not much of it applies, and the unnecessary muscle is dead weight. they don't have much grip strength either for their mass and for things that aren't barbells and they invariably try to use brute strength and their arms too much, ignoring technique and getting tired very quickly. swimming: lots of excess weight to pull that they don't use and they don't even need all the strength they can use, also they have shit cardiovascular endurance. gym should be used as a supplement for sports players, it doesn't train you for them.
indeed, also water is retained abit more of there is a bit of food in your belly so you don't get rinsed out as much and you get hydrated more
a large amount
> you should go running every week or you'll get unhealthy
How much is a large amount
And they’re lifting for hypertrophy and not strength.
>he thinks you can do anything without burning calories
I can kill myself without burning calories
you'll be using calories to breathe all the way until the end. now imagine how many more you would burn if you were jogging into traffic
more than a small amount
Your muscles do slightly deflate when dehydrated. Not that I agree with him.
lmfao imagine being a weak fatty and posting on a board mostly devoted to being fit just to make yourself feel good about not being fit
I live in yurope. No GMOs here
That has not been my experience in judo which is all about that stuff. After a month or two you learn how to use strength to your advantage. It’s probably even quicker in striking sports and wrestling. You mostly seem to just be angry at weightlifters.
I get this all the time
suck a load of shit
why don' you just google water poisoning? if you drink too much your blood becomes hypotonic and your cells start to soak up water, eventually fucking up your brain into seizures, coma and death
Beautiful.
I've read that it's water for the first hour of intense physical activity, then sports drink after that.
>being a gymrat is
(normies think prots powder are roid. I've heard several people saying that.)
They need to train upper body stability(mostly baby weights for high reps though)
>Im going to mc donalds do you want anything?
Yeah thanks for your "advice", I will take it when I want to look as shitty as you
the milk part is true, why would you take the risk?
I explained to a co-worker that I focus on my diet BECAUSE I spend so much time working out and it exploded her brain. The normie mentality is totally backwards — you "earn" the right to eat like shit after you work out once a week for 45 minutes.
yeah or maybe you read too much clickbait bullshit to think being a muffintop is alright
you got the boil and freeze backwards
See you in Valhalla brother

please dont remind me
0/11 b8
fucking miss him lads, 7 years has really past by.
questioning why we loved him means you're not really one of us, never gonna make it
I need to get my shit together man

He inspired a lot of people maybe not as much as Arinie but for a younger generation he inspired alot.

The only people who like him are 30 year old boomers, he wasn't that great.
how many was still posting on here when zyzz did? and what's your age? Wanna see how many of us actually left this place kek.
I was, I'm 25 now
I was here. 26 now.
I don't want to lift on this planet anymore
nice. 24 here. time really has past by quick.
almost 24

I dont know, I was born in 2000 and only been browsing for the summer

Was he natty?
I was posting on the misc when he died , I never understood how to read threads on 4chan so I never came here, I’m 29 still say strong everything in real life , and other misc memes that era, still have a zyzz motivational summer edition vid on my phone lulz
I was and im 24 about to be 25. I unironically started lifting when i saw zyzz posting here and his videos. Finally starting lifting again, and I wanted to know what happened to TinyTrip? Did he off himself?
>tfw already 23
19 was underage b& but I saw him post a few times
24 this month. I caught the tail end.
kek, i was around 15 when i started lifting, so he became a big thing, i liked his body. it was my goal. At that time it was him in the blue shorts when he did the pose first time. Think all the talk about Tinys parents made him quit at some point. I miss supermang tho
2 years late but he is the reason i found out about 4chan and fit
>turned 29 just last week

ayyy I've given up at this point and I give myself over to mediocrity.
I was 28 when he died. I promised myself to leave this place and live my live. I failed.
Oh that's weird I must be posting this from the future.
That /fit will be lost in time, like tears in the rain...
*tinytrip

RIP the King. My reason for starting lifting. A different breed of personality to the fake natties making videos now.
You probably don't see your life as being purposeful, your job included. You gotta go to work and make everything count. Realize that you're helping the community out, and are an integral part of honor, order, and integrity. Also, if you masturbate, stop, if you sleep around and have meaningless sex (just for "fun" sex), that will do it too. Your own heart knows porn and pointless sex are meaningless and so as a man commits meaningless sins, so his own heart can condemn him, even if he doesn't "feel" condemned. Best wishes man, stay safe.

Autosages at 310 posts you stupid FUCK.

Tanned up nicely but its uneven now. Mt2 works miracles if you actually get some sun.
how long do you think my body will collapse on me? ive been doing this for ages and have never felt any problems with my bodily functions outside the dick
You could suck your dad's cum sock for more test than that dose gives you ffs.
what are your liver values and lipids? you are getting bloods done right anon?
dont wana spend money on that shit, when I start making money camwhoring in cosplay I can pay for it
have you tried not taking any ai at all?
gyno hits hard without AI if I take anything past the TRT dose
Time to up the dose little boy
just run Nolvadex year round then it makes gyno impossible
does your dick work though? you could try nolva or high mast for gyno
>still have autocorrect after turning off auto grammar
tried everything, mast, nolva, aromasin, arimidex, caber, the works.
maybe it’s all in your head and you’re just constantly rubbing your nips making them sensitive
noob here , how do i find pages which provide me means of building muscle in exchange for my natty card and money ?
yeah, I can flex my pec and when shit shows up you literally see the gyno popping out
motherfuck have you tested cortisol?
Holy trips of truth. I’m sorry anon. Mast and vitamin b6 are working wonders for mine. It’s been getting smaller by the week, albeit it was never clearly visible. Bout the size of a marble at its largest
the p5p version right? non p5p one doesn’t do shit
Do you get any nerve problems from the b6?
Not at all. I normally take 500mg a day and haven’t had any issues yet. I’ll probably slowly taper up some more if the results start dissipating
Second part meant for Daniel Boome
Lmao brainlet pls go, causes nerve damage at doses needed to lower prolactin but still lowers prolactin
At high dosages for prolonged periods of time.
oh NO NO NO
The point is b6 works in any form, side effects are a different story, have a good day
lmao he’s mad because he’s been wasting money on a supp that is doing literally nothing LOOOOL
>the Pyridoxine Hydrochloride type of B6 (in most supplements) has been shown to be a prolactin inhibitor
No YOU have a good day.
I’m straight
I can't jog anymore due to tendon injuries in the calves. I can't withstand the pain from jumping rope. Recumbent bike doesn't bother me. Need some more ideas.
correction- I can withstand the minor pain from jumping rope.
Literally can’t shit bros they come out as tiny rock hard balls and I’ve been getting bad cramps an hour after meals because I think I’m so backed up.
Eat some fucking greens you absolute mong.
Redpill me on a good laxative.
Polyethylene glycol aka miralax
I don't recommend laxatives as a longterm solution. If you want to clean the shit better out get an enema bag use it once a week. And if you want to keep things better all the time, take a high quality psyllium husk fibre supplement. You literally don't even need to wipe anymore.
Had two wetzels pretzels, 16 kit kat minis, couple m&ms cookies and about to order a fudge brown from mrs fields bakery. Bulking is the GREATEST.
Then you came to the wrong general
>want to put on serious big daddy mass but don’t want to outgrow all my nice new clothes
You'll still fit into your clothes and make the striations pop for ottermode.
You run trt/low test with that or 500mg?
Enjoy your acne gains tho.
this is the most overkill I've ever gone... already feel leaner, and its only week 2. gonna finish this cycle at the end of october. cant wait to see the results.
Low imho. Maybe like 300. Whatever test you use to keep gains will be enough for moderate tren. Low test with higher tren will absolutely exacerbate tren sides though. Always make sure you have caber on hand and if you are really having rough sides consider adding a wet ester or bringing test amt up to tren amt.
100 mg is the low range of normal, which is low. It's about 600-650 assuming your shit is dosed right.
Acne is 90% hormonal.
The problem with trt is they'll give you 100 a week in one dose. Which is retarded and you might as well do 250/300 split up.
Yeah, watch. Unless you're extremely lucky or dark skinned you'll get hit like a truck with all those fats running through your system.
Only had 100g of fats today though, that’s really not much for a grown ass man on steroids.
Also, where did all the tripfriends go? Am I in the wrong place?
90% of them are yuropoors/aussies so they post late at night/early morning Anerichad time
americhad*
Yeah that's cool. I miss a lot of the old dudes sometimes. Jerry, chem, slut, fatlifts, and I hardly see JM as often as before. Those guys were alright. I really just like hanging out in here talking shit. 80% of the time it's not even about gear.

Do you guys just hit bis and Tris isolations everyday for bigger arms? Literally everything is growing like weeds except my arms REEEEE. Tried heavy and light weight stuff wtf.
Literally the opposite. They’re just as expensive as roids with a fraction of the effectiveness and half of them are suppressive so you’ll need to run test anyhow or enjoy being low T for a few months.
starting a 12 week cycle into a meet, heard i need to donate blood to reduce effect of blood thickening. Would doing that 6 weeks out from my meet be an issue?
they found with increased dosing there were more side effects, but for someone who's looking to use a milder substitute for steroids it works great.
You're not likely to find many people willing to experiment with SARMS when there are more reliably tested chemicals which are legally available in some countries. It's just ill advised.
my var raws finally shipped. i'm going to have 15 grams so i'll be good for a while. anyone have experience with oral raws? can i just weigh the var out on a milligram scale and eat it, or do i have to put it in a solvent like everclear?
They give slight gains abs then you’re low T for a month minimum and you’re gonna lose it all.
they’re research chemicals for a reason, steroids are tried tested true and EFFECTIVE
Any thoughts? How long before sore nipples becomes full-on gyno?
Can't sleep in feel amped. I got this everytime in the weekend don't know how
I was 21 Free T and 40 Estradiol on the clomid before I added the 0.2CC Blended Test.
Sit easy brother, a little herb, some shows, no need to sleep if you are still relaxed.
they found with increased dosing there were more side effects, but for someone who's looking to use a milder substitute for steroids it works great.
I'm trying the Zinc citrate route, I started getting nipple soreness last week on TRT level gear.
What medication is Mast?
>surgery
Thoughts? Am I safe riding another week to see if the Zinc works?
You decide which car to get yet?
Source talk is absolutely not tolerated here though.
I definitely need to step back the potato carbs, so I'll get on that.
Both were a waste of money for me and Ligandrol dropped my test by a huge amount.
If you're taking exogenous hormones at >20% bf then you're already set up for side effects.
Solid bro thanks. I think I got an attack plan for the week.
FUCK IT WE’RE STARTING THIS BULK EARLY BABY FUCK WAITING UNTIL SEPTEMBER
Greens unironically. Heavy caffeine doses gives me the shits too but I wouldn't recommend it.
Can confirm with bloodwork.
I take 600mg a day on my EC stack guess it’s not working, don’t eat ANY vegetables at all though lmao.
is it normal to hear voices on tren?
Bimbo says he likes anadrol over dbol because the gains are drier but I thought drol bloats you up too? Anyone have experience with it?
Mogging twinks
dbol is literally the wettest compound there is
Yeah but drol is wet too.
>That isn’t what wet means brah
why do redditors say anavar destroys lipids
Because it’s considered the “side effect free” steroid. Everyone expects drol/dbol to btfo their bloods but not var.
Nice trips. Broccoli is probably the best entry level vegetable if you don't like veggies. They have a really non-offensive taste. Fruits really help move my bowels too but fruits seem to be controversial now so do what ever.
I have the prescription, but don't want it reducing my already low sex drive or cancelling out any sex drive gains from the test.
can i lose weight with low e2? ive read that it can lead to fat gain and ive also read a study where e2 treatment reduces fat
how feasible is just cruising on a relatively low dose for the rest of my life? any short/long-term sides to be wary of? do they even give AIs to people on TRT?
Should I cut while on a 15 week test e cruise for my first cycle, or embrace the bulk and continue eating big?
>Should I cut while on a 15 week test e cruise for my first cycle
Are you retarded?
Adrol makes you strong asf and hold shit loads of intramuscular water. Bad side is it gives me gyno regardless of e2 and prolactin, goes down when i stop though
I honestly did not expect my autism to get this far.
Missing trip
I have no idea what you're talking about. Like at all.
Did a 500mg blast for 20 weeks earlier this year. Id been on finasteride for a couple years as my front was noticeably thinning. It's better than nothing, but my hair fell the fuck out hard core, looks like it did before i got on fin. You have to understand that finasteride reduces dht in blood by like 70% or so, but your remaining nattu 30% is multiplied by like 5-8 while blasting that much test. It literally does nothing for you with that much dht running through your body, and upping the dose doesn't fix it, it just makes all the side effect of finasteride more prevalent.
Don't donate blood before the meet, do it after.
doesnt dutasteride work better?
Finasteride at 1mg a day (for MPB) has only significant erectile and libido issues in <1% of it's users. It's at 5mg a day that around 10% have ED from it. And that is reversible almost 100% of the time.
All that being said, next bulking season is probably gonna be 250-300mg test + deca on top. That should spare the hair a bit more next time around.
Did you get banned?
We'll have to wait and see if any dumb cunts like myself catch their death, but I think it is safe for use short term or in low doses.
post other female pick up lines
Blood thickening is a meme, only cucks donate blood
Don't know why autocorrect did that...
A week or two into the Nolva/Clomid, I got ED, and I haven't ejaculated in over 2 weeks due to lower sex drive, and last time I had sex with my gf after taking 50mg Viagra, I couldn't stay hard throughout. I'm gonna double the dose next time, but I wanted to know how long it'd take.
Just do daily cardio to keep the blood volume high brah
What can I take to stop being smol right nao?
Eye raping
You're more like a talking dog that can say one sentence. Everyone wants to talk to the talking dog and get a picture with the talking dog. But nobody wants to live with the talking dog or fuck the talking dog because novelty only lasts so long.
I am a pretty dog then? Not an ugly shelter dog i hate those
What? Stop the pct soon. I was on bnc for 5 years and came off for 6 months after a car accident. I'm back on now but nova was absolutely destroying my libido. One month of pct max bro. That shit is worse than 74% of all steroids
Except, the longer you're on, the longer the PCT, which is why I'm taking it for so long. I want my Test and Sperm production to restore as quickly as possible.
we're hitting new lows

Listen to me or don't. I don't give a fuck. Your pct is ruining your dick. I've only been on steroids for 7 fuckin years what do I know

Power of pso, saw and keto
How were you considered bigger than most Natty's at their limit after 4 years when you were "natty"? Did you take anything at all?
do you realize that it takes well over 10 years of lifting to reach actual "natty limit"?
Look at pro iffb bodybuilders when they were younger they were 10x my size You underestimate genetics. Drugs does shit without it
Anyone wanna chime in here?
Do you think you reached your natty limit much faster than others or that you progressed faster and still had years of natty progress left after 4 years?
Only cutting as a natty was a nightmare with glycogen loss. Compared to steroids it's nothing
So you're saying theres no point taking test if you have shit genetics?
I pinned for the first time on friday and my glute still hurts from it. I have to pin again tomorrow and I'm assuming I should do the other glute if it's still sore, but how the fuck am I suppose to go into work and walk about like I got fucked in the ass?
Look at spetc and crusader
Why did you pin your ass?
How far into your lifting should you go before you start to roid?
Isn't that where noobs are suppose to inject test? Also it felt fine after and later that day I did lunges and squats is that maybe what fucked it?
You can inject it anywhere
Or end up like crusader infecting massive doses of tren and looking like a stick figure
I know I'm nothing to brag about but it feels good not being mentioned.
They're not even trying. Especially crusader that Fcking faggot.
So without any actual reasoning besides 'It's fine bro trust me', I ain't gonna listen to some faggot on an anonymous imageboard.
JESUS somebody help me
Can you imagine a society where everyone put in the effort? The pressure would kill you.
Especially in the Netherlands it's crazy. Litterly everyone is dyel fat or both. And then how they dress lmao
We live in a shit society when it comes to physical appearance.
Heard someone say that only the cheap chinese product gives you spots - but that sounds like bullshit the seller would tell you
I got a few more moles (like 5) and thats about it.
No spots in your face? 5 more on the body is nothing to worry about..
I've been to airforce festival (netherlands) yesterday and there were a lot of people in shape
Nothing on the face at all.
And ''in shape'' lmao. Still considered skinny fat

The epitome of fitness no doubt!

Not meant to be bait, im being sarcastic fellow roidfag.
Roids made me stupid so forgive me.
You were born that way Im afraid, roids arent that bad.
I swear its the neurodegeneration from my Tren abuse. I used to be highly educated like mast.
>moderate-severe asthma
Guys I can't take tren, muh asthma poor me.
Why would I buy it if I cant take it lmao brainlet
Cook off some of the solvent and either dilute it or prepare for PIP from hell.
Whats that got to do with it? AFAIK BB isnt the cause of tren cough and definately not the cause of cardio kill

I was always under the impression that it was caused by the high solvent concentration. At least the cough part, the cardio part is probably because it fucks with metabolism.
Yes, if you have shit genetics and terrible muscle insertions, no amount of test will fix that. You'll just look like a big piece of shit.
please respond I don't know why i woke up this morning hearing voices i was scared to even fall asleep after that
isn't one of your go to quotes "I wish I could take tren but much asthma "?
superdrol 20mg ed for three weeks
But I actually gained hair from lifting shit. Especially chest hair
Lmao fucking idiots.
What did he mean by this
Yeah, yeah, vanity is a powerful thing.
Preferably I can stay not smol after

Send me some? I’ll give you my love
Fuck off mike
A lot of gays here. Getting almost raped damn gays are fearless
TRT isn't a cake walk either.
Adding mk677 to my bulk, yes or no?
you're on vacation?
Anything else no
You haven’t noticed any benefits from the GH then?
Why are you guys taking steroids? Do you suffer from a mental disorder that stops you from being able to produce testosterone?
I was diagnosed as low test, got TRT, after a few months started buying UGL test online since it was 25% of the price, and from there it was a half step to running my first cycle to catch up on a decade of being a genelet.
they just wanna take it to the next level, natty bodybuilding is a joke t b h
Really? Explain
Now that I’m high test I’ll have at least 5 kids.
Anyone know a good online steroid store?
you'll never a lot of muscle mass at a low bodyfat percentage naturally, it just can't happen
So people that look like pic related are all juicing?
You can either be big or lean as a natty, to be both requires steroids.
Plenty off nattys can look good. You just have to know what to do and how long to do it. You won't look as good as your gearhead counterpart though.
natties can look good, but you will never give off that "HOLY SHIT" sensation to other people as a natty.
You still shouldn't jump into gear unless you're at least on point in everything else. Otherwise you'll end up as some acne ridden bloatmaxx.
GH is in no way whatsoever to memek
what do you mean
Mk is nearly as effective for a fraction of the price. Don’t be upset because you spent a few grand on HGH.
Want to know how I know youve never tried GH
Come on now, don’t keep us waiting.
The absolute state of fraud
It is for fat loss and recovery anyone whose run it below 15iu will tell you its a terrible muscle builder but keep believing youre gonna get huge off memek677 lmak
Where’s the pic bro, you didn’t spend multiple grand for nothing right? You must have gotten great gains to spend what could’ve gotten you 10 cycles worth of roids.
If you can't make gains eating right, exercising frequently, and getting enough sleep you probably shouldn't be playing with your endocrine system :^)
Pls halp, i have to replace 600g to 1kg rice with something that goes easy in.
Or eat nuts. Almonds have like 680ckals per 100grams. Not even fast food has that much
[spoiler]cheat meals[/spoiler]
Nuts are expensive desu
why do you want to eat clean. Energy is energy. 4000kcals from healthy food will make you just as fat as 4000kcals from shit food. fromwether it comes from broccoli or pizza.
Fruits and higher calorie veg like squash carrots etc.
Except shit food messes with your hormones, liver, kidneys
Plus your health will be a lot better, less inflamation and loads of other benefits.
sure its not healthy, but still, energy is energy. 40g of protein from a burger will be used by your body as just much as 40g of protein from nuts and seeds.
Plenty of reasons to eat as cleanly as possible when injecting exogenous hormones.

It's just a deluded, fatty attempt of English people to recreate a pasta dish

I'm not defending the choices that cause someone to be fat in the first place, but losing weight is a process that can take years before you look even remotely passable. During that time where you are making all the right decisions it is painful to not see any tangible effect from them other than the scale.

>"nah, fuck the diet:, let's silence the people who say the right thing"
she would be such a beautiful woman if she only lost weight, her face isnt even that bad now imagine it with 100 lbs less
basically potato salad with pasta instead
THIS IS WORSE THAN BEING FAT
I'm skelly and people judge me, girls don't look at me and I don't see any gains besides the scale going up. You're just playing into the victim role faggot stop being a pussy and keep going
Stop pretending being fat and skinny are the same degree of problem.
knew an actual skeleton in primary (think hes like over 2m now) who could eat absolutely anything and not gain for shit
It also takes years to get fucking fat no shit it takes years to lose it.
it's way easier to go from fatty to /fit/ than skelly to /fit/
>beautiful
>That one beef goblin is even striking with a rock band guitar
My point is more that during the time when you are losing it there is no positive reinforcement. You have to reinforce yourself and that can be difficult when you have a negative self image.
he never complained iirc mind you
>muh metabolism
youre not obligated to believe me
I don't think you got the full story. Either your friend was exercising a lot or you didn't see what he was eating the rest of the day. Hint: it was probably nothing.
Was literally gonna do the same search, on scholar though

he never touched weights and rarely did cardio
I'm not going to argue basic themodynamics on a turkish underwater basket weaving forum at 8:30am on a Sunday. You're right, your friend is the only person in the world who can eat 20,000 calories a day and stay skinny.
>Second ingredient is sugar
good riddance

What's usually in macaroni salad? Is this just a standard recipe with a cup of sugar added?
She may be obese and not really healthy. But, she seems happy and i bet the salad she made is delicious .
what the actual fuck
>Condensed milk + mayo
how do I know that, the same way you know all his eating habits
seething
My eyes are open now.
I checked the abstracts of some of the articles that showed up, and most linked obesity with added risks of cardiovascular issues and insulin resistance. She couldn't even bother to read the 1-2 sentence summary of the study's conclusions at the end of each abstract. Instead, she basically just presented a list of resources that prove herself wrong.
Your friend don't have a fucked up metabolism, maybe he has a faster one but if he had to start counting calories he would gain weight just fine
literally thought the same, if someone like that thinks he can judge obese people trying to better themselves he can get the fuck out
Boo hoo you both have struggles achieving your goals. Go to tumblr if you want pity points for your self diagnosed issues
>she had a stroke walking up the stairs years later
If your skinny friend ate 10,000 calories per day for 10 years he'd still be skinny would he?
> This made me mad but also happy. You shouldnt laugh at people who go to the gym who are overweight they are trying to fix the problem, and yes being obese or overweight is a problem only if it affects your health theres plenty of people who are medically obese and are in perfect health. But you just have to make sure, your healthy and happy.
Fuck me
it takes longer, it's not easier
she seriously wouldve been so pretty if she never got fat.
kek, who do these people think they are?
Holy shit I'm dyel and I look better than him. But its still better than being fat. He isn't contributing to massive healthcare costs. That's all I care about: the fat fucks who are eating up my tax dollars.
Why do fat fucks think its about exercise when that's just a supplement to a better diet?
Nice quads
ah a fake buzzfeed video showing that fatties actually work out but can't lose weight but they also conveniently show her hogging out on a box of donuts and a bag of chips
no normal macaroni salad doesn't have heavy whipping cream, sweetened condensed milk and fucking sugar and you don't use a whole fucking container of mayo either
>not be fat
I have to wonder how weak people are that they can't even stand on a scale without breaking down. Or how retarded they are not to know how to make yourself throw up.
what an oxymoron
because dieting is harder than exercise, so they think just exercising is enough to lose weight. also many who exercise then think they can eat anything because they overestimate the effects that exercise actually has in regards to calorie burning
How do I change this??
Calories in, calories out. Your friend is a stupid nigger.
> But people wonder why I hate fat women.
Lots of fatties are entitled and act superior idk why but when they do it pisses me off
they see their fatness as a disability that they have no control over
I was in Laos until I was 15. If it's the genes then the Mung Lao must have anti-fat genes cause Im pretty sure the first obese I saw that wasnt a politician was at the airport in California.

I think I'm going to be sick.
how is it possible to even get that much sugar in there. i recently drank one of those blue rockstar energy drinks and wondered why it tasted so good. looked at the back of it and it had 70g of sugar in it. felt disgusted with myself immediately. how do you even cope with drinking 260g of sugar
That's my favorite post ever. Also, nice digits.
scale is at least an objective thing that will show if a fatty is on the right way and losing weight even if they don't see it themselves right away. a scale should be their best friend.
Maximum protein
get laid so you're not desperate
kek, that guy in pool was so happy she stayed outside of pool so he can swim around with non-whales
damn, now she joined and he died a little
Well put fatty
It does end with her jogging though.
gtfo fatty
>tfw to intelligent and above politics
because it's buzzfeed.
AND WHAT IS UP WITH THIS VICTIM AT THE GYM SHIT? MAKING FUN OF FATTIES AT THE GYM IS NOT A THING. STOP TRYING TO MAKE OTHERS FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. GET A SCALE AND COUNT THE CALORIES YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTHS FOR GODS SAKE.
its a comment from the video brainlet
People need to realize, and this is the biggest turn off for fat people in terms of recovery, that exercising is not how you lose weight.
Absolutely diabetes.
>thanks for feeding my delusions and not forcing me to change! I’m grateful I can keep being lazy shit and pigging out who cares about my husband lol
maggots only eat necrotic flesh, they were probably keeping it alive by preventing infection.
I agree she actually looks like she'd be a real sweetheart if she was at a heallthy weight. Sad.

god this place makes me sick. i can't even understand the mentality of a fatty who would eat there. it's like a slow suicide.
Because it's based as fuck
That's the point, buddy who opened the place used to be a personal trainer, but got so sick of fatties not committing to weight loss that he just decided to slowly kill as many as he can in the only legal way he could find.
>still 1g off with the bowl
its amazing what this pupper looks like today

Just listen to that fatty wheezing made me sick
no wonder they cry so much over trolls
even in the most simple form it would appear that being fat is harder than being skinny
I swear Americans are a different fucking species lmao
NO WHAT AAAAAAAHH
hahaha
Thin girl triggers a fatty
She edits out breathing now


The reverse is impossible though, not being able to lose weight.
Just eat more you fucking morons, why are you using meme shakes?

Sheesh. Just watched that video. Amazing. And I lost my appetite too!
She's so fat she had to say size twice
really top kek must take a lot of edits
anyone else ever realize that these fat girls only ever post this shit online and IRL they have no confidence and meekly waddle about to and fro
How's that sound for you guys? I might tire out of this afterwards so I wanna know what else I could make with chicken breasts for dinners if you guys got anything. Along with the breakfast suggestions as well.
but yea sounds like youre doing good. keep it up
i suggest doing IF and skipping breakfast, not lunch
Is just any preferes? Or is brown more suggested
im at like 20% bodyfat, so maybe dont listen THAT much to me, but what im sorta getting is, a lot of people overthink it. just dont drink sodas & sugary things, dont drink a lot of beer (get vodka or some shit like that), cut down on the sauce & carbs, and just, eat normal, healthy, protein-rich food. but peanut butter is especially protein-rich. and avocados. avocados fucking rock
Also, is there somthing i could eat the peanut butter with? And what could i do with avacados
and avocados are commonly used to make guacamole, which just... mash them, and mix in some porridge/mayo, and some salt&pepper&whatevers, and thats guacamole. put it in your tacos or in your absolutely whatevers. use it to replace dipping sauce for pretty much any meal. avocados are so protein-rich, it almost feels unfair
You fuckers told me getting /fit/ would improve my social standing and make people admire me. Later that night I was hungry and had to go to the bathroom but was to autistic to leave my room and face them so I just pissed in a jug and felt hungry all night while playing vidya.
Nice blogpost faggot.
Just trying to tell a cautionary tale to my fellow recovering fatties. You have to be prepared in this cases, imagine I didn't have a jug, would have been fucked.
Here's what you should have done. Gone out with them and enjoyed being social without drinking. b-b-but everyone else is doing it. So? Who the fuck cares. And if you meet a girl that you like and she asks why youre not drinking be witty about it, say something like 'because I don't need alcohol to know you're a good lay' ...deflecting is fun.
But it doesn't mean shit if you behave like a autist. Just fucking relax dude, if you get invited to do something like that just go. People aren't out to judge you, if you gave them a chance you'd find most are pretty chill.
Why would you spend the entire night playing videogames instead of chatting with other people or just sleeping? Video games are more self sabotaging
capische?
Its like I can't relax dude, always self conscious and my mind is always racing at 1000 mph. Feel like everyone is staring and judging all the time, maybe because I'm doing it too idk.
Because games are my friends, they are nice to me and give me good times.
Don't be a cookie cutter and live your life the way you want to. Don't worry about what people think about you.
What about having fun and socialising in video games?
Just go out and have a couple of drinks. Order a glass of water with your drink, down the water then socialise as normal. If anyone asks, just say you're trying to stay hydrated or don't want to get too fucked or whatever
isn't the goal of getting fit to feel comfy enough to do shit like go out with friends and fish for qt's? His friend was right you were being a faggot
Fucking retard
Try not to but its hard, my first solution was to not even bother with people so its easier to not care but that was just as miserable. Now that I'm trying to improve I've begun to care more what people think about me since they are my coworkers, family and hopefully soon to be friends and I need them to achieve my goals.
Be the dd for the group, they appreciate you, buy your dinner, etc. Plus if you do find a willing honey just get an uber for dumb buddies, and drive home with her, thotties love when you can drive yourself rather than wait around. When your drunk ass friends get butthurt you sent them home, just give them some reason.
Maybe, idk why I even started on this "self improvement journey" anymore, people are just mean and stupid and I don't want part of this world most of the time.
You retards are a bunch of faggots living a fake life, living for others, just go kys yourself you mongoloids
Sounds like a lot of effort. What do you gain from going out with them?
What does he get out of it? A social circle. and for you autists to recognize, some social capital for future use.
Try taking some L theanine
Take magnesium
People look like spergs when they have this thought going through their head
make sure not to get bunk magnesium like mag oxide. gor for a brand like natural calm
That's because you are low test. Think that guy would have said shit like that to someone who actually looks like he lifts and is high test. So anyway, just keep moving toward your goals and keep raising your test, then that shit will never happen again. Or if it does, your testosterone will make you say something witty and make him look like a retard, you probably won't stutter like a bitch too.
That guy didn't even see me. But I guess he knew I was a fag autist from my voice alone which is even worse.
Man you should have split that motherfuckers wig
its calms you down and makes you much more sociable, also better sleep
Big if true, gonna research it and maybe try it out.
Lifting doesn’t cure autism
>tfw went to a party lasr night with tons of free booze and homemade food and now in bloated for the beach
All you have to say if someone asks why you're not drinking a lot is this: "Oh, I had too much fun last night so I'm trying to take it easy tonight." Then anon will respond, "Oh, I feel/respect that. I've been there." It makes people laugh and think you're actually social.
what does it do exactly? is it a meme?
Lifting didn't do anything to you, you were a fucking sperg from the beginning lmao
Cringe
They are laughing because all of you are retarded idiots.
Why not hang out with them but keep drinking to a minimum? Sounds like you're just socially retarded and using lifting as an excuse
The most hated hobbies for normies are lifting, car modifying and motorbikes
You would look like an even bigger retard. Nah man this was a Chad opportunity to reply something witty and automatically gain the thots favors. This is how you establish dominance.
Unless you’re prepping for a body building show it won’t fucking matter
imagine being such a loser that you interpret an invitation to hang out as a "chad opportunity to establish dominance" lmfao
I'm talking about the guy yelling "GAAAYY".
I am a recovering alcoholic and wish I had taken this advice when I was younger. When I drank I would get quite and kind of introspective. I didnt want to be social, I probably would have had a better time if I had just had a couple of redbulls instead of getting sloshed everytime I went out.
Like you say "Not as gay as being a weak ass twig though". Thots laugh, you go out with them and have fun while that other guy is mean mugging you the whole night.
>say something like 'because I don't need alcohol to know you're a good lay'
Going to the kitchen and making myself a sandwitch while making small talk wouldn't bother me either. Be confident in your decisions, act like you know who you are and others will believe that too.
i was the same way back then
Magnesium?
Just say something like "I am going hiking early in the morning with this 10/10 qt" or "no, can't do, I got an 8-30 rez at Dorsia, great sea urchin ceviche'
Former bartender here. Order a soda water with lime, everyone will assume you are drinking gin and tonic or vodka soda.
This is where OP really dropped the ball. Allowing a stranger to mock you in your own house is unacceptable. Confront him and make it clear that he was out of line. Lots of ways to do it, be calm and ask him what he meant by that or get in his face and say gay is when you choke down all those dicks or anything in between. Your home is your castle, do not let others demean you in it.
how the fuck was he supposed to stand up for himself after refusing to hang out?

Just say 'Nah man thanks' and close the door you beta fag
Should have said Ive got responsibilities,why dont you drop off one of your lady friends ?
Just as expected, they were coming on to me.
Highly suspect you guys are not as tough as you make it out to be. You wouldn't have done shit in that situation.
The things you mentioned are skills except the jerking. Playing games id like playing in a ballpit constricted by adults and claiming b b but im an adult too its just my hobby!!! In the real world, playing videogames is seen as 10x more weak and for losers than its seen as on here. And its correct.
Should of just had the drink it would've been fun and could lead to more good times. No need to get but hurt over a guy shouting out making fun it's all give and take you just need to go out and join in to give

Hes so cringe its unbelievable. Alex leonidas is a legitimate mentally under developed autist
>because I don't need alcohol to know you're a good lay
Just how retarded are you, OP?
As for laughing bitches - they always are addled in the brain - Twitter brain twits. Ignore them.
It would have been a waste of time unless you enjoy being around those people.
People who sit around drinking all day will make snide comments because that's all they can do. They'll call you gay when you hit the gym, call you boring when you work overtime, sneer when you'd rather read a book than talk about football. Just remember soon you'll be jacked.
I don't know about you fags but I run and work out five times a week SO I can eat shit and drink beer at the weekend.
If she wants to find me, shes going to have to try her hardest. I'm tired of this chivalry of how guys have to be at their best to pick up woman...It's been going on for too long. It's time for girls to do the opposite and come find us. Anyways, It's my 2nd month in and I cant wait to see what my 3rd month will bring me. I just want to be the best I can be in my lifetime while playing video games. Yeah you might be jelly because I can do all this while still achieving great success in life but not everyone can keep up. If you had the money, I bet you wouldn't work out. So learn from me.
I don't know anymore, sometimes I think I'm gonna make it, but now the motivation is gone, seemed to have forgotten why I even started.
But you're not /fit/ yet are you, you're still a fatfuck who avoids socializing so much that you piss in jugs. Don't blame anyone but yourself and stop blogposting about your autism, what a faggot
this is even more autistic than what OP did
>be calm and ask him what he meant by that
Use weekends to drink and party hard
No friends or anyone to "party" even if I wanted to, which I don't but apparently it makes me a social outcast so I need to.
Skinny-fatfuck then, stick with it and stop being an autistic bitch
It’s not that hard anon
>I shook his hand later, bought him some drinks, and now we’re fb friends too, just be nice and show them respect

Thanks for the actionable advice. Were you always social or did you have to work at it?
Ive been in your situation bro. I didnt have a jug. I pissed out of my window on tiptoes and burned my scrotum on the cast iron radiator. Not my proudest moment :(
>give out plenty of high fives, everyone loves that
i love that expression
No we didn't
Nice pointers my boomer friend. Hopefully I can manage to talk about peoples interests and some will get into mine too. Its gonna be hard, don't even know what a fucking corvair is and doubt they like anime and shit.

No it’s fake like steroids
There are people on this board right now who this plastic surgery uses actual plastic.
Only to fix deformity. NEVER for purely cosmetic reasons.

Sure, it's Bog approved after all.
elective, no never. it just makes you look like a fucking weirdo. aging with dignity is the true mans way
Maybe to fix my broken nose

understandable have a nice day nigger
As long as you don't go full on doll mode/melted face it should be a good idea.
Always amazes me that it's 2018 and we still can't do something seemingly simple as fake tits properly. Turn off the hadron collider for a minute and focus on what's truly important
My nostrils aren't symmetrical and I think it's because my septum has deviated to the left.
and worse yet, you get tons of people over here who unironically LIKE the massive botched fake tit look.
I would have only something very minor, like gettin rid of acne scars
You mean like life-threatening deformity? Because otherwise it's always cosmetics.
how has no one thought of this before? why have you not started reverse dieting yet, anon?

Basically idk why you’d bother if you aren’t into metal and even then it’s a dead genre and not worth the trouble. Im a youngfag so I figured I’d grow it out once before I become a boomer.

I am extremely ugly so it literally doesn't matter what my hair is like

Does Coconut oil break fasting?
Good, stay away from gains goblins
Absolutely

this shit gets posted every thread
Fasting made me realize that I have never felt true hunger
>haha no it won't break my fast no sir
so i eat 5 days of mcdonalds, and 2 days of a few tblspoons of cocnut oil
Should you generally do OMAD nonstop or is it recommended to break it once a week to ensure your metabolism won't adjust to the new state?
IF is for lazy people just do extended fasts you spastic
fuck yeah bro. I'm down to 200, now it's the home stretch to 180. then I am maintaining the shit out of it.
dont use your goddamn acronyms with me. carb blockers during meals, eca stacks, and coconut oil is the best way to fast.
This isn't /fat/, fuck off

You dropped over 7 kilos in just one week? This was measured after your refeed, right?
Weird isn't it?
Carb blockers? The fuck? You actually believe in this shit? Are you this fucking retarded? C'mon man have some respect for yourself.

The article you link specifically says there's no results or evidence for weight loss. Did you even read it?
just the thought of a low IQ anon stumbling upon your age old post and deciding not to fast makes me ROCK HARD

Thanks for letting me know anon, I guess it's back to daily pizzas and snacks for me
just use a carb blocker
I hope it at least triggered some ketosis, so I can eat at deficit comfortably.
I think I’ll have a nice wank tonight thinking about all the imbeciles who come in here proud of their ignorance
You know it only makes my resolve stronger, right?

How can I force myself to sleep? I'm 72 hours in, dry fast. I'm planning on breaking at 80 hours since I figured I could get an easy 8+ hours through sleep but I'm having trouble sleeping
OMAD is essentially just an IF routine with a really tight eating window right? It doesn't actually mean only one meal right? I've been doing 2/22 IF.
the past 5 days i must have eaten enough for 2 weeks.
Tried ADF for the last 6 days. Although not referring more than 1000 kcal in one sitting, weight stayed the same. Did I do anything wrong? Is this a combination of TRT, lifting and high protein keto meals? Noob gains? Hell, I don't know, but I got a little leaner as I can see more veins through my pale skin. Also I can make my belt 1 notch tighter.
anybody here not fat and do fasts? I'm at the point where I'm not putting on enough weight in between fasts, so my BMI has dropped from 20.3 to 19.3 in just a few months. I mainly do IF 18/6 and one 72 hour fast every 3ish week. what's a good "bulking" regiment to follow prior to and after a fast?
Try a cold shower. If need really be, a small helping of butter.
Yeah you good
refeeding 1000 kcal
This place is almost all fatties trying to drop weight through something called the Snake Juice Diet. You guys have excellent questions but I can almost guarantee the people who puruse theses generals won’t have the correct answer for you. I’d urge you to ask /fit/ in a general like QTDDTOT or make a thread during peak hours tomorrow. Sorry I can’t be of better assistance, but I only feel comfortable talking about the SJD because I actually have a great deal of experience with that.
what are you a woman? just eat and lift bro, what is the point of fasting if you are already below the weight you want to maintain?
thats less than 7kg actually
i am 15% and want 10% but i keep fucking up my refeeds so the actual progress is about the same as a regular 500 cal deficit. only i can have the most sickening pig outs.
I started my 14 day water fast yesterday at 6 pm... that was about 17 hours ago. I seriously hate myself. Why can't I calorie restrict like normal people. Even with OMAD I gain weight!
bruh this is not a pro ed board. I don't care if you hate yourself. just slog through it, don't skip your workouts and drink your snake juice.
Well how many kcal during refeed?
UB0QwI1I
Cole's workout routine is fucking stupid, the only thing he actually knows about is fasting and how the body needs electrolytes. Just follow the sticky, but don't push yourself as hard because your body will recover slower thanks to fasting.
>tfw that means I can achieve anything
Does it matter that there's a noticeable difference in what I lift fasted vs carbed? Carbed up on bench I can do 3x5 225lb, fasted I can only do 3x5 145lb.
Generally, when little/no dietary cholesterol is introduced in your body, the liver just amps up the endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis
>its already 35 degrees outside
It'll help your body dry out as quick as possible, what's the problem?
How much weight are you guys actually loosing? And how much of it do you think is muscle?
The only muscle I've lost from 280lb+ to my current 178lb has been in my legs. I'm guessing it's from weighing less so my legs shed some muscle.
it will make me way more thirsty too
>fast to get rid of (((psoriasis))) at the back of my head
Is sparkling water ok to drink during a fast?
So, just carbonated water? zero calories?
But can it affect the shrinking of your stomach? Because last thread some guy was saying that carbonated drinks prevent that
cole says exercise. like a walk
Sure, which is why I alternate with dry fasts to get rid of the excess water.
Yeah gotta ease yourself into it to give stomach some time. It's nothing dangerous after 40 hours so don't worry.
guess where the water is stored in your body
I'm already at day 5 of water fasting.
You don't have to do it NOW, just plug it into your schedule, like 2 days water fasting, followed by 1 day dry fasting or whatever.
How about a fasting diet which is between these two diets? As in, you could drink just the minimum amount of water to get the salts in like baking soda which protects your kidneys and not to feel like shit?

i mean like a modified half-dry fast which you can sustain. not switching between been dry and wet.
Works for me at least...
it's baking soda, get it right.
24hrs. If it's shorter than that then you're just doing IF/OMAD, which just involves changing the time at which you eat during the day as opposed to actually abstaining from eating.
I'd worry more about the salts than the water quantity
But in dry fasting it's about restricting water intake.
yeah, restrict water, but measure the salts
Says "Baking Powder" on my box.
You're doing it wrong tripfag.
What did it feel like? Have you had heartburn in the past?
Is it safe to end a 5 days water fast with a 2 day dry fast? Should i have some baking soda before dry fasting or after?
I think you will be ok
How does that help feeling of thirst?
If u lift heavy on OMAD, its okay to eat high carb right? Given that you are already decently lean
keto is a meme
Keto is godtier for fatloss not a meme
I'm doing OSAD (One Sip a Day)
are you actually drinking glutinous carbohydrates on a fast
Keto is god tier for short term fat loss, but not sustainable or optimal indefinitely.

tell that to dom d'agostino
Are you diabetic?
but its dangerous?
are you black?
About 1000. Depends on the meat, 600 with chicken, 1100 with pork
repost of my weight loss
Well, having high LDL is always dangerous, considering it's a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis in particular. Get your blood tested, LDL should ideally be under 130mg/dL. If it's way higher than that, talk to your doctor, there are medications for it.
30 hours in a water fast. I dreamt about eating food last night. I felt ecstatic around 24h but now I just feel lethargic.
get busy and don't think too much about food. just set your alarms to notify you instead of checking the time every now and then.
This may sound like bullshit to you but I'm lactose intolerant and that's the feeling I get when I drink milk. Is it like a tight sort of pain in your upper intestine? My mom has a bad allergy to wheat gluten (she breaks out in hives if she touches it) and that's the pain she gets when she eats wheat.
Fuck I’m so sorry
Comfiest fast yet
But would it break a fast taking one?
Is it ok to wash hands during a hard dry fast?
We need our own version of this where all the shelves are empty except maybe apple cider vinegar or losalt
This was in the New York Times comic section on Saturday.
>My mom has a bad allergy to wheat gluten
Well it wouldn't be a hard dry fast if you did, however I always shower and brush my teeth when dry fasting and still get the benefits from it.
Oh shit I finally understand why it's called snake diet. Help am dum
How's loose skin/stretch marks been? I know it's inevitable but I still hope enough dry fasting can tighten me up
At least I think that's much easier
Lol fail

Good job.You were bulking in middle pic?
I feel you
Fucking disgusting how long this crap was in me
Feels good knowing you're getting all of the extra waste out
Hell yeah anon. Autumn can't come soon enough.
Feelsbad that it was even in me.Before fasting I always make my last meal with lot of fiber to avoid this and take a lot of magnesium to flush out all the shit. Looks like it was useless
This is good. I didn't poop for 2 days after my fasts, on average.
nah, just didnt bother fixing my mistake in my progress pics. started at 220
Didnt happen last time I fasted for 6 days.I pooped on day 1 and that was it
can I put a bit of water in my mouth during dry fast and spit it out without swallowing?My mouth is dry as hell

but why.Its not hard dry fast
Well I suppose it won't do any harm, but it may encourage you to break the fast
Nothing more I could say. Everyone just coddles her. I should have asked what type of diabetes she had, and if she ever stopped eating for more than 12 hours. People are just dumb and want to suffer.
you look better fat your skin is weird
im not done toning and losing weight. skinny fat always looks bad
Keep up the good work. You're a little under my starting weight, won't be too long now.
does it currently look skinny fat? does it look saggy at all?
When dealing with damaged people you need to think a couple of steps ahead because you can't treat them as normal functioning people.
What would the difference in results between someone who cuts at a 1000 calorie deficit and someone who also cuts at a 1000 calorie deficit and does IF as well?
Yeps, looks skinny fat and a little saggy. But pull your pants up to just under your belly button and you'd look a lot skinnier. I bet you probably look at a healthy body weight in regular clothes. I used to be at that weight and people thought I was thin.
>Diabetic people are immortal
before you transitioned to male?
does skin tighten as time goes on?
6.8 kilos, but still, that's insane. I have 50 kilos to lose, I could OMAW like he did for 8 weeks or so and lose all the extra fat. That's just two fucking months, what is this sorcery?
How long did it take to feel true hunger?
Is this a joke? He looks perfectly well in the afters.
It does, but the the thing is I started at a lower body weight and body fat than you did, so I didn't have a ton of excess skin by the end of it. It looks like your skin hasn't "loosened" though, so I think you are losing excess skin.

That's the dumbest fucking drawing of a human torso I've ever seen.

That's actually a back believe it or not
are you taking anything?

When did everyone get body dysmorphia ffs
lmao you are fridge as fuck, fucking mirin stop being fag
Currently about 18% and would be happy with opie’s leaness
Lookin nice
Currently 185 at 6'3
Hnnggg
It looks like you do almost no legwork, so build those up.
hey im 6'2" and i look relatively the same with near the same time. Nice to see someone making the same progress as I. tend to get discouraged about how long it takes to make gains
there is no way that is 6'3 at 185 lol. remeasure your height. looking juicy anyways mate
>3.5-4k calories could be on 8k and you'd still be making shit gainz, SS is a milkyboy meme
holy shit you people are weak, if you were 5’7” or below you would have gone insane already huh
You'd just waste them
Pic rel was last year at 205
How the fuck did you get those gains in only 2 months? That looks more like 5-6
pic is 5,9 76-77kg, i very much doubt thats his real stats
He is 100% talking shit that is just not possible in 2 months. Maybe he lifted before or he is on gear.

You should start lifting.
alright yeah I guess I buy it. Its just near your height and look not as great as you at 183. obviously got more fat than you though. I doubt anyone would lie when they're on a anonymous Mongolian basket weaving forum anyways. whats your calorie intake like? Keep the gains up
I was cutting for a while but i will go on lean bulk soon. Are my hips too wide lads?
What should I be doing instead of SS? It was in the sticky.
Theres and article in T Nation which goes by "The Truth of Bulking" by Christian Thibaudeau, which talks about how cutting and being leaner makes the illusion of looking bigger than what you actually really weight.

6'4 193lbs
anything besides whatever the fuck you are doing, increase reps and eat properly, and no oats, beans and pasturised milk are onions tier food, eat a proper diet which will actually provide enough vitamins, cholesterol, saturated animal fat and animal protein, i.e brain, liver, mince and eggs a butter, avoid carbs as they are completely useless besides acting as a hormone for your body to tell it to start amassing energy.
That other fag gave you a massive wall of text. Just lift more. Lift until you can't lift anymore.
Can I get a bf estimate lads and anything I should work on? I've been cursed with wide hips. I'm 6'0 and 194 lbs here
C-can I stop cutting yet? I'm so hungry
Work lats, people won't even notice your wide hips if you have the dorito chip shape.
I don’t see any visible abs, so keep going
I pretty much do pull ups and lat pull downs every day trying to hide it. But they just stick out so far kek. Fucking sucks.
What gives me the best pump for lats is max set of pullups and on the last one lower yourself super fucking slowly. Do that 3 times and itll hurt like fuck
Alright lad I'll give that a go. Preference on wide va narrow grip?
yeah i know, i was fat a year ago so i started cutting really heavily. only recent 3-4 months that i've done a proper bulk, and gonna continue doing so
The wider you get the more upper lats you work, so just do both.
funny how you have so good delts, they (well, the one delt i can see) really stands out
please no bullying im trying to bulk

Even though muscle mass is heavier than fat mass, once you cut down and are leaner you look more buff even with same or less muscle mass than before cutting
5’9” 160 lbs. Cutting for almost 3 weeks, lost 5 lbs. Thoughts?
Nice hips, qt trap/10
Nikka dyel?
But I have no abs, it seems like they will never appear
My main goals for the next year are a +40kg pull-up (+21.25kg for sets of 5 now) and to get to 90kg with less body fat.
Try a picture from further away, and are you leaning forward? Your waist:shoulder ratio looks cartoonish.
Svringe is a literal retard. Fuck off.
Can’t take a picture further away cause my bathroom is tiny kek
What were you doing before lifting? No fucking way you started as a complete dyel, unless you're already blasting something. Or you meant to say two years instead of two months
>185lbs
This is my biggest fear. Cutting a shitton of weight just to find out that I don't have a visible core
I'm a lot better than when I started...
Stats when you started and now
I should also mention my lifts. I maxed a 285 lb bench, a 455 diddly, a 175 OHP, and a 365 lb squat and I still look like shit. But those numbers were when I was 210+ lbs. I feel like my arms will break off when benching 250 lbs. Natty lifting is such a fucking joke.
What gives people that weird long lower torso look? I look similar, would working on definition and trimming a bit of the sides help?
You are allowed to train your core mate. I'm not sure you have a core to reveal through all that cutting, yet.
Stop cutting already
Did you just sit in front of the TV while doing curls?
Ahh lol. Well you're definitely getting some shape though, v taper and forearm:wrist all looks good.
YOUR FUCKING OBLIQUES ARENT YOUR HIPS YOU FUCKING RETARDS
do you unironcially think deadlfits and pull ups are enough for back development??
Lats dont get chicks nobody besides an absolute /fit/ homo has ever said "nice lats"
Post body.
and I have long legs short torso. having a long torso is a more masculine thing and longer legs is more feminine. sucks i have big waist and long legs. genetic failure
No one in this thread is posing for lats anyway
I literally just did SS lol
182, 5'11"
train your fucking abs
Mirin. Lifting stats, routine? How long did it take? I hope you’re natty but I think you’re not
very impressive if true
Im a true human being, so yes
was getting real jealous then i noticed your tiny dick lol
look at his weight and height you retard. He just looks fucking awsome because of superior genetics
Impregnate me pls

Weren't you a roider tho
doubt hes gay
182 Ibs
you look 1000000x better lean, good job
Wrong.
I’m not a man
have I balked too hard, lads?
0.5/1/1.5/2
Your balls barely make an indent in your underwear. 200% confirmed for previous roid use
how many times per week?

>if u have nice hair its not a possibility anymore
what the fuck happens to your chest
>1,94m

some smug looking green guy walked by and popped my synthol implants with a needle
6ft, 171 lbs. Been lifting on and off for a year. Working on upper chest now with lots of incline db press.
roid users fuck off
190cm 100kg
What did I fuck up?
You fucked up when you decided to go 1k calories in excess.
are my hips wide? 4 years lifting body looks a little worse now
how much time lifting?
Pic related was two years ago, first pic I posted was one year ago, third pic was yesterday. I gained nothing before this year. The human body can be weird like that I think
nice legs bruh
tip to get wider upper arms?
lifting weights seriously and exclusively since last october, but i trained and competed in muay thai for 4 years prior.
DB preacher curls are the only bicep exercise I do. I think they’re very underrated
and again
you mean since infancy?
Ugliest abs ive ever seen
Kek if only you knew how much chicks lurk on CBTs just to check out you meatheads

So PPL routines aren't a meme?
tricep exercises are going to give you way more arm girth, especially in the upper section. More of a pushing muscle. Do skullcrushers or tricep pulldowns. Also do bicep curls if you actually want them to grow, chins don't hit them enough and are for fatsos who can't do pullups
6' 143
143 lbs/64.8 kg
yeesh, at least youre packing
(I do pull ups btw, just curious of your reasoning)
chinups cut out a lot of scapular motion and rely more on the biceps, which is fine if you're doing a barbell strength routine where you don't do any arm isolation and want stronger ceps.
I was 240lbs now I'm 193 when I get to 185-190 I'll lean bulk
I would gift you everything I have.wow
it’s a meme (although at least he actually does pull ups unlike most people here). Do just outside shoulder width pull ups. More ROM, better for the shoulders, and you’re strongest in this position.
I know I'm dyle as fuck. Are my nips too big? should I consider surgery? Will it look better or worse with some gains? The thing between them is just Acne and will disappear soon
Thanks buddies.

10 days til beach time
Nice. Work neck more however!
Left is 215 about a month in, right is 204 about 2 months in. Shooting for 190, definitely stagnated the weight loss the past two weeks but my strength is going up so that's something.
not sure what you're expecting people to say, just eat and lift pls
Bro there is nothing wrong with your nipples, you're probably just fixating on them as a way to justify delaying starting to lift and eat properly
>tfw never benched in your life
I just want to contribute to the thread, I'm a cardio fag mostly.
Just bring the delts up and the lats (a lot) and it'll even out,you'll never be zane tier but normies dont care
Do you have a buttondick or something? Anyways, mirin' those arms.
me bulge is me own business
What program did u follow and how did u eat while following each program? Mirin!
Good work on the odonis belt, anon
BAHAHAHA

1.5 years natty lifting
Curlbro mode. Not trying to be an ass but your arms are out of proportion compared to your shoulders and chest (and I’m not even a chestbrah, I hate the fat tiddy look)
Instead of getting surgery to make nipples smaller, just try lifting to make everything else bigger
Trying to grow my arms a bit but other than that i’m Happy with the bod
You need thicker arms, and work out lats and traps. Your body will look so much better
My weight is 83kg not 53. Idk how that Happened
A cute!
most of /fit/ is 14 year old boys that want some girl they can't have. The fact that we keep talking about height tells me this, in addition to a dozen other retarded things. 20+ year old men do not worry about all the shit that /fit/ does
Literally this. I'm so tired of it, everyone thinks they have bitch hips. Idk why
Why is your chest so undeveloped? Delts, too.
Because I train to fight well, having a big chest isint going to help me at all. I need functional strength not bragging rights
your hips arent in the picture you dumb piece of shit
thats not dyle, thats Auschwitz mode
Just benched 315 the other day for the first time
Well, it looks terrible.
yeahhh that's gonna be a post body from me
Lmao post yourself

Pathetic numbers desu
damn surely that’s only for the weigh-ins? you don’t actually walk around normally at that weight, right?
I meant 83kg. My fight weight is 80kg. currently bulking after my last fight
Ok now do it without 2 people holding the bar
ladies and gentlemen we got him
Post body bro
Anything I should work on in particular?
your body
legit a good body, just lose a little weight and you'll be defined
sorry had to. Looks like you got a good base, get your strength up, and add hypertrophy accessories, and glorify in the newb gains
Haha no worries, I’ve high tolerance for bully. Def gaining newb mass and strength... for now. Never heard of hypertrophy accessories before. Will check it.
Like, do high rep accessories to your main compound lifts. close grip bench, good mornings, pull ups, lap pull down, upright rows etc.
I see. I do most of them already, especially in the end to absolute exhaustion.
Would bang/10
did you fuck around with your diet or just bad genetics/angle? no offense you're probably way stronger than little twinkboi me but i think i win aesthetically (three months prog)
everytime
Brb buying test
I bet your ass looks incredible, no homo.
You need to eat and lift some actual weight. I’ve eaten a bit too much of those fucking yummy treats, but that’s only allowed me to become Sam Hyde mode.
~2 months between pics. thoughts? progress is kinda meh in my opinion. Going to start bulking soon
but you're lean, i still got sum chub.

getting back on track
i'd give these guys an awful lot of head
Lifting on and off for a year
add yourself to my list
What are you implying
Not sure if I suck at counting calories or I am gaining water weight from the creatine.
Tryna cut but failing miserably
Routine for your pic? Presumably discus/shotput training / core / squats / low calorie diet, but I'd love a legit routine to achieve the "functional man" look

It’s (a young) Eugen Sandow I think, not sure of his routine but you could probably find it online if you look hard enough
did you used to be fat? Why are your nipples hanging so low?
You have nothing to cut. You should be trying to get strong, not dieting so that you look even more like a DYEL.

Consider ostarine. Very low risk low anabolic sarm.
It's not a meme but most people severly underestimate the training part.
Should I stop cutting at 160 or 170?
TELL ME NAO
Should i cut till abs show and then bulk or bulk now?
Or cut till 10% now and bulk in winter till you can't see abs
160 5’9, bw goal is 176
you sure you're 6ft? I'm a pretty lean 181 and look skinny as hell
can anyone give me a bf% estimate?
Time to start squatting to become wheyfu %.
15% +/- 1%
women dont get that low without gear
No idea but looks fine, and yeah this
I want to cut to 10% but I honestly don’t even know if I’m going to have visible abs at that point and I’m kind of sick of being scrawny and I just want to bulk now
shit, meant 165 lbs
ator.asp?Calc=Body-Fat-Navy
20 seems high, maybe 17-18%
working on it
I don't know, I took this picture first thing in the morning and the lighting is pretty favorable. I hope you're right because that would make shit a lot easier for me
im 5'8 150 too (nearing 3yrs of lifting). looks pretty good. just keep at it
Looking juicy af. What's your height/weight big guy?
Kill yourself you faggot jew
Your scale sucks, but if it’s measuring consistently then I’d rely on it to track progress.
Thanks. I’d be content if I get a V shape like yours in 3 years.
Fuaaark
but i'd like to see the uncensored version
Tell me you wouldn't cuddle with me. Go ahead, try.

6' 77kg
whatever happened to that guy? did he ever cut? he had potential to be my personal hero
also any sense to take BCAA on rest days?
bcaa is just protein, nothing more and nothing less

you only need a 200-300 cal surplus you absolute mongloid.
I wanted to show a good representation of my lower body fat
you_here_from_/r9k/?
Not a chance
You are not 6ft
nice chub
god damn fucking lotion bottle
WHere is your ass
What the fuck. I'm 195cm. I went down to 92.3kg and still didn't look this lean. I'm 98kg now and look fat as fuck.
What do you mean? What the fuck is a navel?
>tfw didn't make this fag's blowjob list
Lol I know I don't look great. And I probably won't look much better for at least a year, but once I cut I'll have some muscle mass at least
Belly button, you inbred
What the fuck is going on here
do more hip thrusts. The angle is nice, but your ass isn't big. make it bigger.
Make gains and mires will be given anon.
Need to work on your legs ASAP
i didnt wanna examine every pic so i just linked the ones that stood out to me. dont worry guy, unless you were one of the fat dudes or that one alien lookin dude or that one dude i suspected might be asian and have a weirdly small penis, id probably suck you as welll
What a generous fag you are, post bp
Everything is big but your nuttsack. Where did your balls go?
Your face is covered though...
I want to pop your bellybutton.
Nice to see you posting again
Good job, now keep lifting. Work arms and lower body.
Is that a phone on the wall?
182 cm
Started working out a few days a week last October, started taking it more seriously and bulking from 117 lbs in January
have been cutting from 101kg, keep cutting or begin a lean bulk? I really wanna get rid of the remaining waist fat.
>heavy compounds are enough for abs
Cut till fall
its not impressive, im barely like 100lbs so no ass :(
will do, thanks
don't get discouraged, it's tough I'm in the same boat. Lovehandles are a burden even at a lower bf.
19 y/o, 6'3", started at 328lb
This is so true lol
I have to go one week without a gym or any exercise equipment. Can you guys recommend some exercises/routines with body weight only that I can do over the coming days?
The only clear reaction to that combination of feelings is rape. It satisfies both the lust and the rejection of her humanity
as long as you don't act on it this actually looks like a logical and fine thought.

see, what I think is, that our culture is all "women shouldnt be objectified" is kinda detrimental to women, cuz what I see when i go on instagram & whatnot is, women are whores regardless. they all WANT to show off their body so fucking badly, they do it anyway. but since our culture is all "thats objectifying", theres no way for them to make a profit off of it. so theyre stuck doing it on instagram for no reason, instead of being able to actually make some cash, which, historically, its pretty evident that its in female nature to benefit off of their looks when theyre young. but now we're all "you cant, because we know whats best for you"
Planks
awesome, thanks dude
Just take a week of rest, silly.
Wow. You got all that from an image? Is she someone you know? Is she someone I should know?
It is pretty standard military pt.
working out & coffee are the only things giving me dopamine atm, so.... i cant. legitimately addicted
ill monitor this thread to see if someone recommends something else, but if not, ill probably be doing that over the week, and ill keep the text saved somewhere for a rainy day. cheers
its a copypasta virgin
No problem. One thing to keep in mind is it is very tricep heavy, so if you can find a heavy object to curl, you are golden. Resistance bands are great for this too.
Nice pasta fag.
What will I look like at 70kg 6 foot? Will I have loose skin If I am fat now at 80kg?
You’ll look like you do now minus 12.5% and no you probably won’t have loose skin
hell no, at 80kg there will be no loose skin
Thank you.
I'm a skeleton at 80kg, same height. How the fuck are you fat?
no problem. Now stop worrying about non existant future loose skin and actually go loose weight.
>Going gym tomorrow. I'm almost pure fat. Not obese but no muscle definition either.
You might have lose skin if you've been fat like that for years
get yourself a buddy to go with. someone with the same goal as you. otherwise I fear you might quit early.
I am going to stick to SS now.
It's over
It's okay if i can bulk slowly. I plan on going bear mode.
No, 5"11 here and 74kg but I often climb up to 83-85kg. Good luck buddy.
Saw a twink at the gym with rolled up 5 inch inseem shorts doing leg press half reps with 4 45s per side. He kept adding more while reducing his ROM until he literally could not fit more 45s on the bars. When that happened, he started stacking more at the top of the slidy part.
Okay, cool.
I wish leg presses were just straight-up banned. Can't tell you how fucking annoying it is to try doing something like deadlifts while there's a faggot doing legpresses and snatching up like 20 plates so he can wiggle his ankles/knees a little bit, and you're forced to search around the gym scrounging for plates
>tfw ywn have a t rex twink headlock you with his quads
>2 weeks later
one can only hope. I couldn't get a good shot of the guy using the machine for obvious reasons, but in this pic you can sorta see him struggling to do 1pl8 on the head-up leg press (just behind the head-down leg press)
fucking hell man I didn't wanna see that
wait, so he just left all those plates piled on like that?
he was alternating but when he eventually left, yes, he did just leave them there
NOOOOO NOT THIS FUCKING SHIT AGAIN
what a fucking goon, let me guess he just left the plates there when he was done as well. fucking youtube cancer that has made mongs think moving their legs 2-3 inches is getting a workout
GET IN THE SQUAT RACK IF YOU ARE SO STRONG

hehe, I see you started this thread with nice trips, hehe
>completly malnourished
Wow what a mastermind
Based and redpilled
Not an argument
What happens when you turn one of your enemies into your light?
not watching the vid but give me a quick rundown on the diet.
cTNit330
tldr we're winning
That's fine, but fuck, leave kids out of your twisted ideologies, poor fucks will grow up wrong
so this basically is the carnivore vegan gainz
Also for my Athens bros, feel free to shill some good gyms, I want to go to a new one.

From a marketing standpoint this looks pretty genius though? Can't really hate on it, it's just a smart trap for fat people.
what would they say if you just walked in with an empty bag, filled it up with boxes of food, and walked out?
they get caught in an infinite "no judge" loop
I'd destroy them if they were anywhere near me desu
Is Propel /fit/ approved?
bro just drink whatever the fuck you want
Vlt98FLA
I would have rather stood my ground and refused to leave. The Animal douche isn't an employee/managerial representative of the gym.
if I saw it I'd snigger
top lel
I'd use weights I could lift properly and not be in this situation
But the kid is fucking retarded and headed for snap city.
>people on /fit/ are unironically defending commercial gym retards that think you shouldn't deadlift unless you can do it in perfect silence
is this what its like in the manlet pit?
Not even Ripp himself would defend that kids bullshit and the man will lie to your face and say that deadlifts will make you grow a foot in height and an inch in length to get you to do it.
I just watched this and Im fucking furious. Deadlifting today in honor of nattybro
True that kid shouldnt be dropping the weight every rep but that foot on the bar is grounds to to fight or kill
Everyone has their headphones on anyway. Why does the gym need to be like a library? Faggots like you are just intimidated by dudes who arnt gymcels trying to lookmax to pick up a single mom.
lmao, the fact your referencing mark ripptoe as some authority shows youre a novice. stop making retarded posts and learn something before you speak
pic related
Starting Strength literally says the deadlift should be a controlled drop, and that trying to do slow eccentrics with heavy deads increases risk of injury.
you dont know how to deadlift
His form was totally fine.
you're supposed to drop it once it's below the knees do you even lift.
is right, even if he was dropping the weight in freefall from the top of the lift there's no excuse for what happened.
Post your body.
Lastly, I never at any point called rippeltote any kind of authority. I am saying that the man's entire thing is wanting people to do basic powerlifting shit. Even lying to do so and even HE says that what the kid is doing is faggot nonsense.
It's a straight drop.
They should go to planet if they want a lunk alarm and the sound of people weight lifting at a gym pisses them off.
He's coached by fucking Pete Rubish. Kid's in good hands and is told what to do. Still some internet warriors tend to know better. Just pathetic.
its called getting stronger you fucking mong. the entire purpose of going to the gym. and how can you make fun of the light weight, thhen in the same post say hes stroking his ego. are you retarded??
POST YOUR BODY, YOU ANGSTY MOTHERFUCKER.
he did like 5 or 6 reps before that sand nigger nut shotted him.
Spit in his face, or something like that, so he gets physical first and later you can claim it was self defense.
Rip is a knowitall fat fuck and can go shove barbelll up his ass.

https://youtu.be/I0uhDZ06hrQ
Everyone involved is a tremendous faggot. The weight belt and hand wraps for his baby weight is basically a trench coat and a fedora. Doing it at buzz fitness makes him the biggest turd in the punch bowl. And the roided bloat lord can fuck off too.
why the hell does anyone care about these manlet spics? lold at the incomprehensible spic speak after the guy got owned by !ANIMAL! spic
The guy clearly sounds and looks Asian, dude
that's what spics look like when they are pure blood. DIsgusting little things barely reach 5'3
lol @ "spics" and "sand niggers" this is literally what French people look like. (i know it's in canada but I've also lived in France)
Strop trying to be a "macho man" theres reasons to why people do what they do.
that's 4+ decades of heavy squats and deads for you
He got pretty fucked up the time he got thrown from a horse, IIRC.
also, immediately after posting that i realized he's like 70 now. still pretty good, i suppose
It's my go to Ripp kek video. There's so many elements that make it hilarious.
Why do you fucks never think of alternate reasons why someone is doing something?
Ironic how Charles talks to him in French at first and the nutshotter responds in English. If anything that's what an anglomutt looks like.
Why is everyone saying he dropped the weight? He's holding it the entire descent?
While two friends hold down perp drop 45lb plate on his chest.
Are you expecting him to have no upper back round, shoot off the floor, and slowly lower it back down? Because if he was only doing that he'd never make progress since he wouldn't be pushing himself whatsoever.
I do rock climbing and always deadlift with straps to save my forearms for it, can't recover at all if I don't
As in, this guy approached me, slapped the barbell out of my hand mid set, got in my personal space, raised his voice and pushed me? Lol, I'll be straight up honest with you. I'd literally jump on him and put him in a standing gulliotine so fast he wouldn't know what to do. And I wouldn't just put him to sleep, but I'd intentionally crank the fuck out of his neck to leave him injured. He'd black out and if he had any liquids or solids in his system he would defecate his pants. I'd then proceed to inform the gym staff that I was attacked and had to defend myself in self defence, and possibly press charges on him.
There's nothing more infuriating than trying to lift while some cocky faggot cat-backs his deadlifts and drops them from knee height. The entire fucking gym shakes and nobody is impressed. Anyone who feels I'm in the wrong can fuck off to a gym that has the facilities for powerlifting, rather than a rubber floored gym like in the video. The retard interrupting him during the pull is equally retarded but if I were there I'd silently take his side any day.
Broken back - you lose. Fatality.
>this is how untrained people actually think
lmao he's barely fucking dropping it. setting more than 3pl8 down gently is almost fucking impossible for most people. doing a deadlift then a romanian deadlift is fucking retarded. As long as your not being an obnoxious cunt and dropping it from full height you're fine. Kid even looks like he's protecting the floor with some mats. The fact that you think mark rippetoe's opinion even matters just shows how new you are at this
Tough shit faggot, hes not even an employee. You dont chimp out and man handle a kids thats annoying you. You tell the staff and let them deal with it.
You don't need any more context other than what's in the video. He assaulted the kid for absolutely no reason and the fucker deserves to go to jail.
I'm 1/8 jew btw
hmmm. i think i've put together the puzzle boys
honestly who goes up to someone in the gym and behaves that way? The guy is completely full of himself, his ego is inflated to the point where he thinks he can approach people, scream at them and lay his hands on them. The deadlift "dropping" is really no ones concern except the staffs. If they staff have a problem with it, let the staff approach him. Fucking douche bag thinking he can tell other members what to do.
Post a picture of yourself so we can see what sort of experienced gymrat you are, otherwise fuck off and don't try talking like you've ever been in a gym before.
The reality is that 99.99% of you clowns would behave even more submissively than that faggot whimpy kid, deadlifting like a scared cat and dropping the barbell to bring attention to himself. Absolutely pathetic. I've LITERALLY approach some 18-20ish year old looking kid at my gym 4 years and told him he needed to stop dropping the barbell. He loaded up 3.5pl8s on the barbell and started doing broken back deadlifts and he LITERALLY dropped the weight while he was standing and it shook the gym. Someone has to put dummies like that kid in his place or he'll never learn, and talking all "sweet" and "kind" to people doesn't work, you need to let them know you're not fucking around and you're serious. That dude who approached the kid is unironically a alpha male chimp who's confident in his abilities. And that kid is a beta male chimp who's terrified of his abilities in confrontational situation.
If there are bumper plates at the gym there is literally 0 problem with this
If I witnessed - not going to lie, unless I saw it all unfold and understood the situation perfectly, I would be one of the slack jawed guys gawping from across the gym. Maybe if the physicality escalated if step in and try to break things up. But when you're an outside observer it's difficult as hell to make a snap decision on who's in the right, who initiated it, etc.
and that alpha male chimp is going to face assault charges. time to get out of your fantasy world
imagine trying to make an assault case out of pushing someone. lmao. literal beta male shit. good luck with that bud.
and yes, forcefully pushing is assault, I didn't create the laws mate, no need to lash out at me
Bumper plates aren't common in chain gyms. Please note the kid in the video isn't using bumper plates, or even a deadlifting platform. It looks like he's got fucking yoga mats on the floor.
He didn't kick anywhere, and yea yea yea. hide behind your little "laws" and try to make a case out of pushing. lol. You must feel like such a little weak wuss knowing you aren't capable of defending yourself. can't imagine how pathetic and scared you must feel when you go out in public
>t. knows nothing about the law
>yeah I'm in jail for 30 days and owe $10k in damages, but I'm alpha so all is well
>hide behind your little "laws"
The kid isn’t retarded. The retard in the video is equally retarded to you though.
This. I've always kinda been a "bully", lol, not a harsh or nasty bully, but a bit of a irl shitposter. All my life, when I was in preschool, throughout middle school and highschool, I was bigger and more athletic than everyone and would pick on the social out casts. That's carried over with me into my gym life. When I'm at the gym with my bros I'll approach the dumbass ego lifting teenagers or young guys in their 20s with horrendous form and mock them to their face. Sometimes they don't pick up on the mocking and sometimes I can tell they do, but they never say anything. Not a word of a lie, one of my favourite things to do is hard-eye an ego lifting doing dog shit form on a lift, and then as soon as he's finished, I will do the EXACT same lift with the same weight, I won't even do a warm up, and I bangout a bunch of reps with full range of motion to make it look easy, and sometimes I'll take it to the next level and follow them to their next exercise. Moral of the story, if you're a goof in the gym, don't be surprised if you're fucked up. You literally deserve it, for the sake of mother mature in determining who are the alpha males and who are the beta males.
Read a book, my guy.
when will the Lunks learn?
At least in the US shoving someone is considered assault. Kicking someone in the balls too of course (although that’s a no-brained)
Rip would die if he attempted to walk more than one mile.
You a retard if you think breaking someones jaw is better revenge than fucking them over with criminal charges.
Lol hilarious dude. I’ve been a similar shithead at my gym. It’s fun mocking shitty lifters to their face
continue=2&v=dF69ja_chTk
so satisfying
Maybe you should consider getting a membership at the local faggot book station if the scaywie loud noises distracts you from doing your curling exercises.
With everything else I would just laugh at him for being a pathetic angry man. But with punk move.. no way I could keep my cool. I'd nearly jump in if I were just a witness. Some people need some sense slapped into them
I don’t see why it matters why the kid in the video is using bumper plates or using a deadlift platform. He’s not lowering it super quickly and definitely isn’t dropping it or slamming it, so I don’t see what the problem is. The mats on the ground is retarded though because they won’t do shit besides make the lift quieter. He’s doing it because the gym told him to do it while deadlifting and he’s following their rules so he doesn’t get kicked out
Says he's going to sue the gym. nah fuck this guy now. Lost my respect
And not only is his form trash, it looks like he's presenting his ass for someone to stick their cock in.
Imagine being so insecure that you have to go out of your way in the middle of your workout to do this instead of just focusing on your own training. Not sure if this is a copypasta
fuckin dyels in this thread i swear
People who slam weights in gyms that aren't for weight slamming are faggots. And yes, my complete anger against loud noises may in fact be caused by autism
The rest is history.
https://youtu.be/NM6wcz8iWCk
fucking gains goblins
Well, he kicked him in the nuts while he was completely upright with the weight. Could have injured him pretty easily there. A fucking bitch move for sure. The faggot looks like he has a glassjaw.
>The gym is my safe space
Kudos to the kid for not fighting back desu. I'm sure he was smart enough to remember he was still on camera.
The alpha will be going to jail and you can guarantee he will be taking more dick than the kid that was deadlifting in the video.

you are either some random dyel, or the dyel that kicked the barbell out of his hand. In either case, you really don't know shit, and you should just admit it to yourself.
I think you fat sacks of shit and twinks need to actually go out and do something athletic, not play around in the gym for hours a day.
he probably regretted that shit the second the kid talked back at him, and decided he'd double down on the autism to keep up appearances.
what are your training recommendations for the deadlift?
>He didn't deadlift corectly so i'm allowed to punch him
I'd say perfect form and not dropping the weight like a faggot.
What the fuck? I wish there was some 120kg powerlifter to back this kid up.
From buzz fit gyms website
That gym's gotta be made out of marshmellows or some shit. Plus, who even gives a fuck about someone deadlifting? He's not purposefully slamming or dropping the weight, that's standard fucking DLs right there. Anyone with any experience whatsoever wouldn't bat an eye at the kid. It's only ever dyels that complain about "noisy deadlifts", and my guess is you're one of them.
Nah, fuck this gym.
Pete Rubish should go there and deadlift 400kg right next to that guy.
protip: if you can't answer this without attempting to google or youtube deadlift technique/common errors, then you should probably just stop here and consider actually start lifting like you've been meaning to do.
still no reason to sue them
Doing extra sets of a lift that has high level of potential snappage while being tired is fucking stupid.
He said in his personal update on the situation that he's keeping the details of suing the gym to himself for now. Probably has good reason. My guess is perhaps he brought it up to management and they put the blame back on him and let the other guy go.
>Faggots on /fit/: dude his form is fine lmao
drop the weight on him
My problem with the form police's arguments here is that they have no idea what the kid's training routine is, are passing judgement based on what they think his sets/reps should be like, and think they know what's best for his form, even though he's being coached by an advanced powerlifter.
To be continued
>"heh nuthin personal kid"
This was a good read, thanks anon.
Holy shit kill yourself you posturing brainlet
You can see his form breaking down and you can tell he's struggling to lift that shit.
Keep lifting and aggressively tell that retard monkey nigger to fuck off. If he gets more violent then report him to the staff and sue him later for assault or if there's no staff there or the staff are a bunch of assholes that don't care, then knock the guy out in self defense and keep deadlifting. Seriously, fuck that violent sub 60 IQ chimpanzee. Very few videos have made me this mad recently.
>but some metal clangs is too much
Do you people get paid to push this narrative?
It's fine if you don't know much about lifting or have little to no experience in general. Just don't go around spreading bs.
Umm sweetie, in real countries that thing is considered a monkey nigger. I don't know what other thread you're talking about but judging by the fact that you're defending the ethnicity of this aggressor seems to suggest you might be a nigger yourself.
/r/ the original pasta
If i was a witness id probably just watch and do nothing.
I looked up a video on YouTube from this guy named Alan Thrall and he said you shouldn't bend your lower back and you should clench your ass. This kid is clearly not doing that hahahah guess i win again
REEEEEEEEEEEEE

> "Y... you too."
wouldnt be surprised if its fake
Fuck that kid in the video
If I was in Florida i i'd shoot him in self defense
yeah dude getting forced to drop a >150kg diddy mid-rep with straps on wouldn't feel good
>imagine trying to make an assault case out of a video recorded assault
This, fucking faggots
Of course.
You are so heavily autistic it is unreal. You're probably one of those 40 year old neckbeard faggots that cant lift anything.
Reddit DYEL invasion is on full blast
don't do anything and hope it gets violent, I doubt that they're vegan
you're a fucking beta cuck, deal with this shit yourself rather than 'tattling' you fucking pussy
holy shit is he actually autistic
can i ask how much you deadlift

Not involved in this thread but you are distinctly and overtly dumb. Good day
Jesus fucking Christ
This wasn't funny in the other thread you posted it in, and it isn't funny here.
Both are speaking english, these arent true french.
fucking great read dude.
168.75 cm is about 5"6, which seems reasonable since plates almost reach their knees. Am I in the ballpark here?
Seriously, what kind of pansy faggot are you? I bet you have never pulled one plate off the floor in your life.
They both look like manlets. Probably 5'6 to 5'8 at best
Nice larp, faggot.
Both dudes and everyone in this thread are retarded and gay
Not sure if diddly guy was very smart by not escalating the fight after he got shoved or if he's a pussy
15 seconds into the video and he throws the bar on the ground, why does this kid think he owns the gym?

I ask the manager to watch the recording and decide what to do. He will most likely kick the fucker out and ban him. Next I make a report to the police so they can investigate if there was a crime.
Is this bait or are you serious? I genuinely cannot tell, like nigga c'mon lolololololol
proof deadlifts don't build a spine
Canada has a mutual fight law I believe. If the deadlifter escalated back and they fought, he'd nullify his legal options afterwards. He did the right thing if he plans on getting any money out of it.
so many chinks and brownskins, makes US look great .
More white than you, Tyrone
My gym bro is a black drug dealer for my fraternity. Pretty sure he woulda swung

This, my back would be "beyond repair" until after the case goes through and that roided manlet can't even afford a box of oats while the gym is filing for bankruptcy.
a new copypasta was born today. bless you anon.
You’re such a queer.

yeah nothing gets women wet like legal debt and criminal records
Man, if this is real you sound so unbelievably beta and pathetic. I'd love to see you try this shit with some of the kids in my gym. I'm come over and slap the shit out of you, you little cunt.
Jonathan is the prime example of an autistic dipshit having an episode. the guy is like a parody of the bad guys steven fucking seagal fought in his movies. wtf !
exactly what happened
mind that i go to the worst gym in town, just a small block gym, cheap, dirty, broken equipment, lot of dudes on gear, but it's nearby and i like the guys there.
What a beta virgin, hit him back like a man
Someone in comments is saying roidspics fb is jeanphilippe.bernard.50 , anyone confirm?
A real chad would show them how to do it properly
I wish some faggot would start shit like that with me in my gym.
I bet he will never go back to the gym either, afraid to meet that guy again.
If this happened to me i would have picked up a dumbbell and smashed it on that dudes head. This is assault and im gonna defend myself. Why i would do this? Becoz i cannot live with the fact that this mid-eastern fuck shoved me for no apparent reason and i did nothing in response. Bruh im not even that strong im 5'9 and 136 pounds but i would fuck this dude up
take a dumbell to his head.
they never learn, do they?
Holy shit, I've never seen safeties at the right height before
Diserved
hmm, so this is what a retard looks like
dumb kid cant control his emotions
Honestly I would try to contain the immense rage building up because I'd be scared to get fucked up if I tried to fight him. If it was less confrontational, I would have been like "dude it's a fucking gym, leave people alone and wear headphones if noise bothers you". But this is such a bad physical insult that I would be speechless, I mean I should probably take boxing lessons or something because I'm pretty sensitive.
all you wannabe hardasses are pathetically transparent
I know for a fact people haven't always been murderous pussies fighting to look like the victim in court.
100% right thing to do.
just lift shit up and put it down you starving vampire, goggle eyed cunts trying to stand over people in gyms are ignored more often than you think
If that was me it'd be like the ending of Jet Li's the one, where I do a backflip and take him out with one kick and then his friends start coming at me from all angles. The owners would see this and start blasting Papa Roach at full blast on speakers. This would last for 25 years.
You're out!
I know you want to blast that fool but you have to be situationally aware or you'll find yourself fighting 3 meatheads and as weak as they are, you're still outnumbered.
Why run away like a pussy? And why are you idiots advocating violence? He did the right thing albeit the pussy way. Involving the cops is always the right thing.
you cant take dudes on the internet seriously. Of course they'll say how tough they are and they will eat the eyeballs and first-born son of anyone that crosses them. In reality, everyone's probably a bit timid and trying to stay out of trouble (assuming you live in a society with social norms)

Rip is talking about letting the weight drop from your hands at the top of the rep, dumbass. You can watch him deadlifting on Youtube and he does the same thing this kid does. You're not letting it drop in freefall, but tempering its descent and letting it drop slowly.

he didn't kick him in the nuts you fucking mongoloid he put his foot on the bar to stop his lift.
how many times are you going to try and use the appeal to authority fallacy
There is literally no other correct answer other than giving the cunt one warning not to touch you and then slugging him in the face if he does it again. The fact that there is some kind of discussion going on here as though there are other answers is something I find baffling and mildly disturbing.
The boomer looks Arab or greek
there's nothing funny about getting raped by the gym alpha, sorry his post hit too close to home for you, did the cops swab your anus for dna collection?
I bet all his protein is onions

thank you, kid's a fag
something is a fallacy only if it's a distraction or irrelevant to the discussion. Having a well-known coach personally training you is relevant when talking about whether you're knowledgeable or train in a legitimate fashion
My basement gym can't be seen by any private investigators a defense firm might hire so I could still lift.
Based, redpilled, and alpha as fuck
And in doing so he toe-punched his nutsack
I may not be the most aggressive guy on the planet, but if someone started trying to grab at me after stepping on my bar mid lift then that's a fight. Kudos to the guy for not just popping the faggot in the jaw.
>muh fallacies
He looks like the kind of kid that spends 2k on lifting in his first year and never achieves a 400 wilks. I don't condone the jihad, but man, both these fags look like retards.
what kind of retard acts like that desu ....
you don't get to state random guys are experts you fucking mongoloid it takes standards to qualify. in court if you tried calling a roided out gym bum as an expert you'd get laughed out the fucking court room, kys
Kudos? He lost his manhood that day you cuck.
I'm sorry I'll just feel like shit all day if I don't point out this autistic detail. I'm a lawyer.
that is enough of a provocation to fight back
I had a situation at work where I got in to an argument with some guy, I'm experienced in these situations(beta) so I got nervous. But I knew I had to be the man I want to be, I have to get into a fight and can't back down, no matter the outcome. So there's only one option, you fight. Now it's simple for you and the bitch that's trying to bully u has to make the hard choice. fights are natural, u need at least a couple of street fights to be a man.
this is literally the /fit/ version of the tanner copypasta lmao
No, you don’t know how to dead lift.
Regardless of whether or not the kid was deadlifting wrong or being inconsiderate of the other members, no grown man should ever go and kick out a bar from anyone mid rep. Fucking terrible man.

lmao i ain't a faggot
What’s it like to have a gf? Do you love her? Does her being happy make you feel happy?
Then we go to my room and I fuck the shit out of her raw and cum directly through her cervix. I wait about 10 minutes and then do it again. If I'm full of cum I'll do it once or twice more.
What if you used her butt like a pillow
What more could a man want?
I do that actually
im so proud of her :D

in a month? what the fuck
Roids, obviously
I live about 45 miles west of chicago, can I come fuck your gf? I guarantee I am better looking and a better fuck than you are. Im also married and have 3 boys so my seed is quite potent. I would probably get her pregnant on the first try and you would be stuck caring for my child. I think you might like that however. So what do you think??
we broke up because i cheated on her though
Yeah sure buddy, that seems realistic.
the good life, enjoy
Is gonne hit you hard when leaves you m8 sorry in advance
I'd probably fucking kill you tb h.


I doubt that, but whatever floats your boat cuckboi. Let me know where about in chicago you will be i can come talk to your old lady for you. Im sure she will see things my way.
and they'll use sex, the one thing you want from them, to get everything they want from you
Maybe you haven’t found the right woman
op here, this is actually my reality, you were probably hurt or read too much incel shit on the internet and now you actually unironically think all girls are whores and evil
She ran already, so getting her into lifting was easy.
Just wait until 9pm and stand on a corner alone in Englewood. Don't worry she'll find you.
Have you?

If your gf doesnt want to fuck you just as much as you want to fuck them, youve fucked up a long time ago.
Not yet, but my past relationships haven’t been bad either
LOL only weak-willed faggots get cheated on
when they get comfortable they stop trying mate
she wants to fuck me more than I want to fuck her actually, I could literally make her blow me 5 times a day every single day and she'd happily do it without hesitation
Maybe stop being a whipped faggot? I can see where you're coming from, though.
Yes. I'm training her with a basic strength program. The ass gains are great, and she likes getting stronger.
shit's perfect
and her mothers passing is not the reason she's like this because it's been going on from before that
I want a perfect unacheivable dream to work towards and my lifes mission will be to get as close to that as possible.
they get used to you being there and start to take everything for granted then blame you of doing the same
yikes she's bout to dump u brah
She killed her mom to guilt you into staying with her.

I'm sure you know all the tricks. Your posts read like you're 16.
this is a very good post m8
Embarrassing post
Are you argueing that people shouldn't want stable and happy relationships? Obviously it won't be always fun and you will get into a fight sooner or later even with your perfect dream woman but whats your point exactly? Lol
funnily enough i've been in a relationship since i was 16
You've been together a whole year? Wow man that impressive.
I feel like she appreciates me more and more, and doesn't take anything for granted
it's fun to question peoples relationships when there still new because they get so defensive like their gf is special and their relationship isn't the same as everyone elses shitty relationship


And how long did those last? Because fuck me if you or anyone here tells me about their still amazing dream gf and cuddly/sex life of 5-10+ years.
I started dating my wife 8 years ago. We still fuck a few times a week and have a ton of fun together. We really are best friends and do all kinds of stuff together.
But... Does. She. Squat?
She's more of a runner/yoga type, but when I drag her to the weight room with me she'll actually do real lifts.
faggot
I've seen some old people who've been together their whole lives still madly in love.

Anon, it's simple. You gotta keep working on yourself non stop, for her AND you. If you want a woman that will keep trying, you need to let her know that she's replaceble. Not by telling her, but by always working hard so you could get another if she ever cheated or she stops trying at the drop of the hat.

How do you fit and play an instrument inside a car?
It’s really sad because it just further confirms the idea that women are children, but it is reality. A woman will only gain more and more respect for you the more concisely you draw your boundaries and call them out on their shit. Her knowing that you arent her babysitter and that you can drop her ass any minute for her retardation will have her madly in love with you. This is the only way to keep a woman happy forever: be a man, call her out on her shit, never ever lose your temper, and be her emotional bedrock. If she starts flying off the handles, literally walk out of the room and say you’re not coming back until she collects her thoughts and is ready for a talk.
Post gf
I want you to read your question again and realize how retarded you are. There are a multitude of instruments that fit inside and can be played inside cars.

how can a man be this stupid?

Is that Big P when he comes home from bullying scrawny gooks at the gym?
>hopefully next time will be better
Stop watching all porn. If you have to jerk, do it to the thought of foreplay with her and also tongue punch her redhead pooty. It'll get you super diamonds when the time arrives again. Porn desensitizes a man as they delve into more extreme shit.
Right in a benis :(((
STOOOOOOP STOP IT NOW I DON WANNA FEEL THESE FEELS KEEP YOUR GF BUSINESS TO YOURSELF PLEASE FOR OUR SAKE JUST LEAVE US BE
mfw hearing about "juice cleanses"
YOUR WAY
she likes to go with me to the gym. she doesn't make very much progress on squat cause she has horrible proportions for the lift (daddy long legs, short torso) and is very thin. I got a coach in the gym we go to to help her cause I'm a manlet and the squat has always come easy to me cause I got stubby ole legs. its nice to spend time with her and eating when we come home after the gym
Both of us are grad students, we work busy hours in different labs but the evenings and weekends are pretty much fuck, cook, lift, fuck, watch Netflix, fuck, go to the pool, shower, fuck, sleep. Pretty comfy desu, she also likes my immature sense of humor and that I still call her tits my breast friends. She was the first and only girl I've ever laughed with while making out. And it doesn't hurt that I can curl her and physically throw her around the room.
Fuck bro, I hope your kids inherit after you.
Meh, we figure with 5 of them it'll be alright. Plus the old average your heights plus 5" leaves my boys at 6'3". Don't want manlets but I also don't care too much. Want to raise them how I wish I was raised so they're not on a Tibetan Nipple Painting forum at 11:30 at night because they're away from their gf for a night and lurked for years before they were happy with their lives. Want them to be the Chad I couldn't be.
bodyweight, yeah
This is really it boys

Number one problem are Broken people crying about others being broken.

HAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA OH NOO OH NO OH NO is this board real or everyone is this autistic?
at this point in time I am starting to feel sorry for the faggots such as are your self
I actually don't feel anything reading this. I'm not jealous, I don't feel like I'm missing out, I don't feel bad about being lonely and I don't feel bad about how I spend (or waste) my time. Am I broken or something?
You are not broken. Maybe you are introvert, I am one. But I also know it will be nice when i find someone i could feel alone with, saying nothing, just enjoying being in two
I'm happy for you.
That guy just described going out then fucking his gf. It's an ordinary thing you see every time you go outside. People here are just extremely pathetic
Literally anyone can get a gf, I just keep them around until I find my pure virgin waifu who will be worthy of bearing my seeds to fruit.
I think having a girlfriend is ultimately a distraction, especially if the main thing you value from your continued interaction with her is sex. Logically the only time you should take a girlfriend is if you are considering making her your wife. In practically every other case, a girlfriend is takes more than she gives.
Satan speaks the truth
fart in a bottle close the lid let it sit for a while then take a big whiff
how the fuck is her squat only 125 while her DL is 240? what the fuck does this chick look like
I know this because my dad left when I was 4 and I'm an emotional wreck
god you're insane

what do I do lads? she’s still very attractive but I want her to be healthier and more active
But that's me in the relationship, buddy. Go sit on your MGTOW subleddits.
Bruh your gf is a fat fucking whale.
Is there any other way? desu thats what i miss most about my ex.
No, it's mommy issues. You did not get enough love from your mother and try to replace it with girls now. It's the same with girls and daddy issues
I am truly a 19 yo boomer, my glory days are gone. I miss what I had with her back then
Then you can kiss her too whenever you feel like it
She was probably way stronger than just squatting the bar when she started idiots
My what?
......maybe one day bros
We're all gonna make it one day, I guess
Stop going after bad women. Man up and quit settling for substandard pussy.
My gf is loving and caring, but she's overweight. It kills my sex drive and she feels unloved. If she could not be so fat everything would be great.
I'm the same, I have no problem with being alone. I'm focused on my career 24/7 and I'm fucking awkward with a bunch of emotional baggage anyways, I accepted it and moved on and now I can honestly say that for the first time in my life I'm pretty happy with myself.
have you tried telling her that?
Unicorns don't exist
I've told her that she's overweight and it matters very much to me that she is fit and healthy. That's about as nice as I could've put it.
You sound like an immensely huge faggot
you sound like a coping incel

>second guy already has a bandaid on his finger
Does it count if we go long walks and she does it to piss?
dont be in a rush and dont let the lack of a woman ruin your life, just get out of the house and talk to some women
Lel they only do that shit if you tolerate it, don't let them get away with it and they'll break up before you have to or they'll prove themselves at least semi worthy and stop that shit
get her to wash first and it shouldn't be as noticable, or if she's a heavy bleeder just do it on the lighter days or in a shower or something
I think they call that aromantic or some shit nowadays
Old age, surrounded by a loving family

I love seeing other people in happy relationships.
>thinking thicc is the same as chubbyfat
you guys lied to me, this is way many fat lazy ass 50 year old drunktards are strong as fuck, i wont take advices from you anymore
Legit, I agree.
cold showers are useless and fasting only works if you have stomach, liver problems
I have it as a goal but I'm not sure what a realistic timeline would look like.
It took me about 8 months from nothing tbqh.
does OHP count in 1k club or is it just deadlift/squat/bench?
Should take 3-6 months starting from nothing if you’re doing SS
For people asking 1000lbs club is Bench, Back Squat, and Deadlift. And about 1 year of solid lifting, with a base from sports.
also, >implying anyone gives a care how much you row
Took me a year of serious lifting
If it is taking you significantly longer than that, then you are fucking up somehow.
so about 2 years. could have done it sooner if Id known more from day one tho. spent alot of time trying to eek out LP when I should have moved on, and had some injuries
>implying anyone gives a care how much YOU row
My best lift is 1pl8 ohp
about 15 months on a PPL but i also did a lot of cardio so could probably have done it even sooner
I was in the 1000 pound club in high school, but my football coach told us all that instead of swuat it’s leg press. So I wasn’t really.
6 months ish... bench was the hardest to get up
5 months, but i wasnt a newbie, i knew what i was doing
lol if leg press counted Id be in the 2000lb+ club
I'm at 925 after a little over a year.
anything less than 8 months = you have shit genetics
Learn 2 clean then you can front squat
no its curls and tricep extensions
I'd say it takes about a year. More or less depending on how good your training is and whether you're actually going for 1RMs.
I was 235lbs so it took me like 5 months of SS lol
So get a fucking squat rack/cage/stands. How can you honestly call it a home gym without that?
>implying anyone gives a care that you lift
In your opinion, when should one switch from LP to another program?
around 3 months give or take
I'm thinking of adding weighted chin ups and taking the weight I do from those off of dead lift, cause I have a bad lower back and am scared of snap city.
wtf kind of logic is that?? just follow a non retarded program with appropriate intensities and have good technique
Idk mang, Ive never really deadlifted consistently or tried to go too heavy cause I've seen too many people who went full retard and got messed up backs. Im going for aesthetics over strength so having a mega heavy dl probably won't make much a difference right?
you need to deadlift
Shiiiet. Got any links or info on why it's so necessary / benefits?
that said, you can totally get aesthetic without doing deadlifts. if you hit the lower body with squats and get the back with weighted chinups and rows, you dont need deadlifts
That's what I'm saying. I know they're super great as a compound lift but couldn't I hit all those muscles with a variety of other less dangerous lifts?
What's the respectable female equivalent of 1000lb club?
sounds like coward bitch ass talk to me
Hell, I know a guy who looks incredibly jacked and all he does is rock climbing and pushups, squats, and chinups with a weighted vest.
The can do 45 mins of cardio at 6.5mph on treadmill and have a huge booty and tight pussy from squats and hip thrusts club
I just want to be able to walk without pain as an old man.
700lbs. It'll be about the same wilks equivalent.
Literally just do rows, chins, face pulls and calf raises with deadlifts and you will be bretty good
What a fucking bitch.
BW = 275 lbs
I'd like to agree with that, but would edit that amount to 750 lbs. Women absolutely mog men when it comes to power output in squat/deadlift, pound for pound.
8 months. But i was severely obese then so i guess it would be longer if you were skinny
But don't tell the other virgins

You have to be at least 18 to be here son
>gaduated
Worded that badly, I meant I deadlifted 140kg when I was 15. I'm 18 so no worries
Overall i feel like i have more cons than pros but oh well, best to just work with what ive got.

dam man, we sound very similar, I'm also a 5'7 manlet who can pack on pounds and is intelligent, but has pretty bad social autism. Im currently at university and play on the lacrosse team so I have a great group of friends and have access to all the best social events at school, but it doesn't really matter cuz i suck at talking to girls and can't get laid. I have suffered from low self-esteem since high school, but I'm hoping to change that going forward into my junior year at Uni

It's a meme you dip. I meant that I'm good at sex, i always make the girls cum at least twice, one of them vaginally, the other with cunnilingus. I have a hard time cumming myself though, must be all the porn, im doing No Fap to correct that.
Pick one, retard
I'm hitting on an engaged girl just so i can cuck that random stranger, indirect revenge.

Decided to just fast and do heavy bag work instead of beating myself up about how shit my lifts are. Seems to be helping to beat that voice inside.
It seems like you made this thread just to praise yourself while talking about your insecurities

Just read the sticky, so SL 5x5 and stop overthinking everything before you’ve even started lifting
start doing a legit 3x5 5x5 program like starting strength or stronglifts, everything else is bullshit. no brosplits. and care to increase your back and shoulders , they will give u size not your pecs
Allright, should I follow this one:https://stronglifts.com/5x5/ ?
definately, once you milk you strength gains there start doing texas method
Yo /fit/, let's get kind of a CBT except if you post body I'll sketch a picture of you, pic unrelated
Thoughts on boil-in-bag rice? I bought a pack, hoping it will save time.
>heating up plastic
dude you'd be better off buying a $20 rice cooker over the long term the mark up on boil in bag rice is insane
no plastic in the microwave
Disgusting. Jasmine rice best rice.
patrician choice my friend
If you like burning money and having plastic in your food, go for it
Don't cook anything in plastic. Rice is incredibly easy to cook. Buy a 20 lb bag of long grain basmati ($20) and cook it on the stove. Saves a lot of money too.
Carbs - forget it!
>open the bag in a bowl and it will have all the seasoning benefits without any actual peace of onion or garlic on your bowl
So you never eat ready-to-eat dinners that you microwave?
no, i'm not a man child
correct
Also you can make your own stews and soups in a rice cooker, surely you want that, dont you?
Why would I?
>You're trying to....gain weight?
And why not? Even doctors said I am too skinny when I had annual checks as a teenager.

>Anon, you need to stop lifting those heavy barbells, its bad for your joins. Just go on a jog every day!
>A gallon?
>how many eggs?
>and this drink is called snake juice?
> AN 8 HOUR ARM WORKOUT?
>and you eat them...raw?
Why is 7 out of 10 doctors, literally unhealthy as fuck.
>you've not masturbated in how long?!
>and you haven't masturbated for ...2 WEEKS?
Cause doctors are a joke.
hivemind
>TFW never ever had a bodybuilder patient
>and you do these "deathlifts"...how often?
>you havent eaten all day!? Thats so unhealthy!
you only exist to hand out antidepressants and diagnose people with diabetes
GOMAD? Dont mind if I do0o0o0o!!
I just want to be thicc
I bet this is what doctors actually believe.
>now this piano man, he tells you to take how many... "scoops"?
When I was in med school, I expected lots of athletes. Now I see it's just people trying to sue their companies or needing papers for welfare.
god bless america
So yeah, bodybuilders/teenage boys do go to the doctor too.
>a femenine penis?
Shit, anyone that wasn't after benefits would make me happier.
That's some strong bait.
>You wanna follow the advice of someone who died from snorting pre-workout?!
Anyone got the Jeff Cavaliere and Rippetits ones?
yeah no shit, because doctors actually want to be healthy and not /fit/
You're that actual doctor earlier in the thread aren't you?
oh. carry on.
They basically sit in an office all day listening to old people and hypochondriacs bitch about everything. They probably use food and alcohol to relieve the stress when they get back home then go straight to bed
thats over a minute later
eat 100scoops a day and see what happens
OBSESSED

>and you eat what when bloatmaxxing?
A doctor told me that their nephew start sleep walking because of protein and creatine, becauses of that my mom reeeeeeee'd at me when i wanted to buy sups, but my dad was ok with it
what don't i eat while bloatmaxximising
> HOW MANY ONIONS A DAY?
Good one
>I know that you are using steroids, I know you are too stubborn to convince, here is an address to a chemist that offers clean needles use them.
>...9000 calories a da? Bloatmaxxing? You have to live it? Pendlay sumo hexbar tsunami deadlifts?
t-top kek
>YOU HAVENT EATEN IN HOW MANY DAYS
You should have to pass a test and get a permit to be able to procreate.
this one got me for some reason, fucking hilarious

>eat 50 kilograms of rice a day and see what happens
Some don't even want you to jog because it's "bad for your knees"
>What was that? Oh I'm sorry but this is NON NEGOTIABLE
why is nothing up for discussion

>suck 1000cocks and see what happens
thank you based doc
j-jesse
you probably would be very famous
Its true though. That entire general is retarded and borderline suicidal
Kekked.
>breathing puts stress on your throat, you should just get a trachea
>and you have how many scoops of protein a day?
Doesn't that depend on how much protein per scoop (PPS) there is?
well, what were the results? did you get kidney failure?
but then there'd only be white pe-oh I mean yes yes that does sound like a good idea! It would promote child welfare and make sure children aren't being born to parents who will cause them a life of pain
mirin skull doc no homo
Sure, because sports medicine is a very tiny minority of medicine overall, and most doctors don't have anything to do with it. A doctor's advice on exercise is no different than a plebeian normalfag's.
in /fit/'s mind a "scoop" is an objective measurement no different from a liter or gallon
said to every male over 200lbs with < 15% body fat
>so you put a really heavy weight on your cervical spine and move in a dangerous and compromising way over and over because you want to "take the neck pill?"

/fast/?
top kek, I already have a pretty thick neck but I just decided to try this out after all the neckpill threads. I'm convinced it's gotta be a troll. Start trying to do neckcurls and I keep hearing a very unsettling crunching noise of my cervical vertebrae cracking and popping, with the sound being transferred over to my ears directly via bone-to-bone contact. NOPE.avi'd after that.
a "scoop" is an objective measurement no different from a liter or gallon
i think the implication is that some idiots roid and don't tell their doctor
Snake Juice? I must've missed a maymay somewhere.
head to /fast/
Well if you are 200+ pounds it will fuck up your knees.
Are these the same guys who were blasting and cruising DNP a few years back?
It's just easier to tell people "don't run it's bad for your knees" than to try to get them to make all the proper adjustments so they can run properly
i'm not really for or against it yet, i think more research needs to be done. however, there does seem to be some promising research suggesting its true, just not enough for me to jump on the wagon yet
nice may may
I don't know how to break it to you, but those guys died bro. RIP.
