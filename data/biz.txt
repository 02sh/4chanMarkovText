i brought it back a few days later when i was done with it.
Just transferred restaurants. My last day I filled my bag with extra cookware because fuck the chef that has to re-order all that shit when he finds its not there. Wish I would've started stealing shit way before that. I was actually taking home like a couple pounds of filet mignon to have something to eat on my days off. The more days off he gave me the more I'd take.

how do we honestly kill everyone who's not on board with saving the planet? I'd like to douse 80% of politicians in gasoline and light them up, including the trumplet. When my daughter is my age she's going to never have known even half the beauty of the planet that I did. Fucking sucks.
get over yourself, the planet will be fine. humans on the other hand are fucked

You moron, scientific consensus says that shit is going bad. But nah, you must be smarter than the whole scientific community combined
The endgame of the boomers is radical ecocide. Every mineral on earth will be mined and turned into electronic consumer goods, every last drop of petroleum will be squeezed from the earth to power their SUV's, golfcarts, and lawnmowers. Every last tree will be cut down, processed into sawdust, and molded into particle board using petroleum glue to create mcmansions.

Hopefully someone will turn you into consumer electronics after you kys to reduce the earth population

That’s some nice meme posting boys-you should reward yourself with a nice juicy bacon burger and some shots of Jack maybe light up a Marlboro
I hope you hoard bigmac coins while you can. best investment you'll ever make
s o y hoarders will be shot an numales will wander weakly though boutique fair trade coffee stores turned by their heavy burden of paper backs by karl marx. Evil farmers and fishermen will be sent to re-education camps eliminating the last people who actually knew anything about nature and everything will be made out of paper bags.

just be active on it, seen alot of people break even after a year or so doing this. Don't get gready on one, sell out of it to buy into another.

Just telling you from my experience and others that i know that have tried that whole dividend game.

since its a chink company, how can you be sure the figures arent total lies? Like userbase and such
or do they unlist stocks under x value each day?
Talked to a few chinamen when on work and the number of top shows they produce every cycle is proof enough of its scope and reach.
The chink stocks have been extremely profitable to trade on the Bells, when they drop 4-8%, they always bounce back to thre mean by morning

no because its going in a direction, likely up, by machines

I enjoy a nice chicky noodle from time to time. Their clam chowder is yucky though, get a better brand for that.
It simply bounced back from the panic, the rise to consumers hasnt actually been priced in yet. Disclaimer I dont actually own any shares
you use to be able to count on the boomers to at least keep their cupboard stocked with chicken noodle for when they got sick but millennials will just order soup off of a trendy corner stop from grubhub delivery or some shit, they probably even pretend they never get sick and take stimulants to conceal it or whatever.
I have in mind the French brand, Michel et Augustin. They basically sell the same packaged biscuits, yogurt and snacks. But they managed to hype them up and give them an "artisan" feel to them.
It's a good wait and see. I don't plan to get rich overnight with it and I won't lose my shirt.
It is a play on the shale oil value chain as HCLP sells fracking sand ("proppant"). They just declared $0.75 for a QUARTER and my model says they are able to maintain it at least for the rest of 2018. They just keep on pumping them shale oil and they are not stopping whatever the oil price.
Im pretty sure most people use Swanson as chicken broth
hurry up with the podcast so I can take the friday nap
the cool and trendy thing to do is to make your own broth with chicken bones and shit. haute couture. if you cant do that, at least fake it with bullion cubes and water but for the love of god if someone sees a can in your kitchen going into their food, you're out of the kool kids klub, for good most likely

No it’s a terrible idea. Took 25 years for Americans to trust South Korean brands, and those are made by capable engineers.

not gonna lie, I am heavily considering buying a 6 pack of monster original
they'll sell "artisanal bone broth" in one of those cardboard boxes for a 200% profit margin and it'll be literally the same stuff as in the soup cans
this is my first time buying the zero ultra.. i think the original is better desu
I always got red bull instead, I figure I'm helping pay for their F1 team

Nonsense. Schools, hospitals, and plenty of regular people use Campbell and their holdings, at least in the States. I don't know that they have any sandnigger offerings, which would explain a smaller presence in Europe.

I hope rkg posts nudes of herself soon. She's gonna die anyway so it won't do her any more harm than her cancer already is.

>stocks going down despite beating earnings
How dumb would it be to put all my disposable money (10k) into class B Berkshire Hathaway stock?
Someone posted a graph a few days ago that plotted several ERs from companies and the movement of their stock price the following day. Turns out it's most likely to move down regardless of an earnings beat or not.
I guess at his size that is a political thing. Why wouldn't he be invested? It's a smart play, really..
it should be better than the dow because it's buffets total return index, since it hasnt outperformed the market this year it should be a good entry point

Prime pride for United States of America
I don't follow. Can you elaborate please?
Should I unironically buy a bag of HMNY?
Just buy the whole thing
you guys got a room on stocktits?
Not very dumb at all, lest you think you will outperform him and his companies of course.
I kind of want to gamble $100 just in case a buyout happens with HMNY, but I gambled almost $100 on 300 shares before the r/s, and now I have a grand total of $0.14 from two worthless-as-fuck shares.
No. I'm dumb.
So I live in Las Vegas and was too lazy to actually go across the street to 7-Eleven to gamble properly. I unironically put $25 into HMNY at $0.05 per share which seems to have been the floor. If it goes bankrupt oh darn I could have bought 6 Big Macs with that. If it goes back up to a dollar I make out like a bandit with 500 bucks.
I bought $7 and already regret it, they'll probably do another reverse split and then it'll do another drop from $30 to $0.0001 in a day

Up 20% for 2018, finally broke through $150k.
should i just blow like 100 bucks on HMNY? what's the deal, what makes you fucks think moviepass is a good investment. Didn't it just get obliterated in teh last year or so?
I just put in the money I made shorting HMNY into the stock -RIP 450 dollars
Betting on a buyout
It's a garbage business plan. No hope for it.
*beep* buy ROBO *beep*
Ah I see. Might as well then? the payoff could be enormous, compared to a relatively little loss
>FARNSWORTH'd
why? popular among students, no? or do you mean administratively?
The hope is someone would buy it out thinking they could reorganize it
The new diet coke flavors targeted toward millenials are godawful.
I bet if they change the stock name to Moviepass MOVI it would moon :3
I hear the US oil pipelines are basically running at capacity. Are you not worried that this will put a limit on the demand for fracking sand?
Anyone here like PEY? High-dividend grouping
You have much better odds betting straight in roulette than a buyout of HMNY. Nobody wants to take their debt on. Only thing of value they have is the data from movie pass;but you can get that from FAANG.

I recently invested in the Vanguard index fund for the first time ever, but I'm a little worried because we've been in a bull market since 2009ish.
I think there will be a pump up to 1 dollar, before it fizzles out for good.
It's the thrill of the gamble.
Hadn't heard that yet. Sad.
Go look at what happened if you sold everything right in November 2016 and bought back in in January 2018. Go fucking look. I lost out on like fifteen thousand dollars because I hadn't yet learned that everything, every fucking thing in the news media is false.

Yeah, into bankruptcy. Look at the 5 year graph, it's like a game of Skifree, all the fucking way downhill. Steam and digital distribution companies have been and still are kicking their asses unless they turn their business around to being more like an actual electronic boutique.
Yeah check my divs. I don't really see any divs on your table so we'll check mate
but yeah i'll just look at a 5 year chart and let that determine my whole trade.. how new are you?
but hey.. if you want to just base all your trades off of a 5 year chart... well then best of luck to you.. i'll see you in 5 years
Any chance it could go back up I bought 20 shares today because I had a buck fifty left in my Robinhood buying power.

Go tp tradingview and look at the BTC/USD chart for the past 7 months. Look at the major 3 "peaks" we've experienced. Now turn on the RSI. You'll notice that the (daily) RSI is higher and hogher every songle peak but each peak is lower than the last, on a massive 7 month scake. What do you notice about this pattern?
wtf chart? weekly? Monthly?
they're accumulating...

explain what Link does as though you're teaching a retard who knows nothing about crypto or oracles
its a meme
DYOR/lurk more
In regards to actual project that chainlink aiming to achieve it's nothing more than a basic json parser for smart contracts, would take like a day to add to ethereum by itself.. literally making links whole concept pointless and definitely no need for a token. Would take a lot longer to get it working with bitcoin but the bitcoin core devs would be able to work out the solution a lot quicker than chainlink will, think that's something worth noting that literally nothing is completed and you're literally just buying a whitepaper, they have only 2 developers and they don't communicate at all with no proven background on either, in fact sergey was involved in a project before chainlink called NxT that he since been abandoned until it was took over by a new developer team
don't buy
>t. don't know what the project actually is and thus can't teach it to another
link makes sure that the dominos you ordered won't be dropped to the ground or be mistaken with anothet pizza by retarded delivery wagecucks
good start. what is the pizza in this analogy? is there a simple way of explaining how link makes sure the pizza is your pizza?
its a meme dude
Thanks for the post, I appreciate when people like you post here
so no one can explain what link actually does
LARPs as an Oracle based solution to some imagined problem I forget what it is. Basicly a LARPcoin.
is resolves the oracle issue
It’s a newfag trap at this point. Pajeets on biz hold 1%
Buying a few hundred LINK today for a thousand bucks and holding them for the next several years will afford you a house with a garage and a lambo to park in it.
ChainLink will be a decentralized Oracle network.
Glorified json parser with a lot of unrealistic goals & imaginary partnerships.
All my instincts tell me it's a meme and I'm being worked but my life is so miserable that I'm throwing money at it based on the off chance that maybe it could possibly make me rich. Feels like I'm playing the lottery.
Imagine that you rent an apartment in the city a few years from now. The lease is a smart contract. If you call the health the department to have inspectors check your apartment for mold, and their tests discover unacceptable levels of black mold, those test results are passed to the smart contract from ChainLink nodes paying attention to the various sensors and air-gaps of the world, et cetera. The lease automatically terminates, awarding you your security deposit back, instead of the way things work now, where the landlord just evicts you because it takes too long and costs too much to go through official channels to fight. Smart contracts keep people honest. ChainLink keeps smart contracts honest.
What the fuck does an Oracle network actually do every time I try to understand ChainLink it sounds like an autistic LARP. I know Oracle is a database software workplaces use is that related to Link? Also how does Link "connect smart contracts"?
There are so many ifs in that scenario. It’s not gonna happen anytime soon

so? those are all correct facts


LINK has tools for APIs to be developed into it. That way it feeds smart contracts with the info they need, since like I said, Smart Contracts are retarded and can't read if a payment has been deposited into a bank account, or if there is a flight delay, or if a sports team won the finals, or any real world application you can imagine Smart Contracts could be good for.
Basically this guy called Jason Parser figures out a way to get free Big Macs for life for all link holders I think. Big Macs are like $4 so that seems like a pretty good deal to me.
That sounds cool but it sounds very subjective is there source code I can look at?
Are you joking? An oracle (lower case o), is just something that grabs offchain data so it can be read on chain. Unrelated to the company, Oracle. Ethereum can't see anything that's not on the ethereum blockchain. So an oracle grabs data that's not on the block chain, for example, the conversion rate of usd to eur, and let's a smart contract on ethereum see that. The data can be from the Internet, a private database, wherever. An oracle network is a group of oracles. You can have many oracles come to a consensus of data, just like miners come to a consensus of the state of a blockchain. Or you can try anyway, it's a difficult problem to solve.
Fuck you, seriously do your own research. Im not gonna spoon feed a begging little faggot just because he asks. If you care then you will put in some work.
Link will standardize how APIs interact with blockchain technology while also providing tamper proof access to real world data through the use of decentralized oracles.

The project is open source. Just look at the github.
then fuck off nig. others are interested in helping
link is "decentralized", so it spreads out the risk across many points. this is much more reliable and secure. this is it's advantage
i'm computer illiterate. i don't understand the terminology but i could learn with a more brainlet-tier explanation
thanks anon. what types of things do blockchains need to "see"? can you give me some examples? does every project need an oracle? do the major projects like eth and btc have these oracles? is the "oracle issue" what you have just described i.e. centralization?
Pathetic
Chainlink is eyes, ears and mouths for the robots.
how are you going to decide who is right? You can't just meme average the data between feeds, only one right answer is possible. What's the exact criteria to determine that, for example, the private data feed is wrong and the internet data feed is right?
pretty much this
*my main concern
its just a meme
you're unironically a massive idiot if you can't understand how this is a very good form of research that has advantages over reading a shitload of jargon with no one around to respond to your questions. neck yourself and fuck off.

There are literally countless threads to lurk and read. So much information already exits on this site. How are you just now looking into this project after almost a year of constant shilling on this board.
Yes, though it gets a bit more complex than that. you are ready to begin your own research, so you will find more in-depth information as you go
How are oracles run and how do they become centralized? How does Chainlink uncentralize them?
it solve prbolem
So, nobody can answer this? Allow me to rephrase my question: how do you decide who is right and wrong between oracle responses? Does this work using a credit system of some sort?
So we have smart contracts on the blockchain because we don’t necessarily trust people, when value is being passed around, to behave honestly without exception. So the smart contract acts as intermediary to make something happen under certain programmed circumstances. Problem is, most circumstances that can occur are going to occur in the real world, not natively on chain. And the blockchain can’t be regarded as the silver bullet of deterministic truthfulness, because it can only work with whatever input someone has given it. I may want to track my flight itinerary so that I can get some insurance payout in case my flight is delayed. But if the insurance company provides their own oracle to input that data to the blockchain, they may fudge the numbers so they don’t have to pay out. I can’t trust their oracle, they can’t trust my oracle, but if we created a network of oracles incentivized with rewards for honest data transfer, we can all be reasonably confident that accurate info is inputted. Hence decentralized oracles, especially those that make use of trusted hardware, become essential to the trustlessness of the whole smart contract ecosystem
one last question and then i'll start digging up a bunch of stuff: why is a human oracle less threatening than something like a centralized oracle? i understand why a centralized oracle is dangerous, i don't understand how a human oracle isn't capable of being centralized. again, i'm having trouble visualizing how it all works so this question probably doesn't make much sense
More importantly how can feeds be trusted from uncentralized oracles
excellent summary. exactly what i needed to read. so what is the reward for honest data transfer that compels each party to contract in good faith?
Staking your tokens, if you don’t answer with the majority of nodes, you can be penalized. This is at the discretion of the client contract. Also, nodes get reputation, but this has not been fully explained. Supposedly there will be multiple third party reputation services that nodes must register with, and they will monitor a reputation for nodes. It doesn’t sound very pretty right now, but apparently it’s the easiest way to prevent a Sybil attack. Also trusted hardware can be used to guarantee that computation hasn’t been tampered with. When all’s said and done, however, everyone is at the mercy of the data providers, who must be trusted to accurately and reliably offer data required by the contract
Not gonna explain it again. You missed the 17c entry already anyway. Gg nolinkers.
if it's going to 1000 like you faggots say i think i'll be ok getting in at sub 30c

The fact is, LINK is going to share the same fate as ETH will. A lot of 'real world application' hype, with a lot of 'crypto world application' reality. Only, this billion supply coin isn't going to come close to the $1k that Ethereum hit. Happy gambling though anons.
I understand what Link is trying to do, but I'm skeptical about the entire decentralized oracle model they are proposing.
Your point is valid, but what do you think will happen when PSD2 takes effect? For those of you that are unaware, next year the EU is enacting new regulations that will force banks to make their APIs available for outside fintech use.
And the reward is basically payment for doing a job correctly, each node is paid for completing the terms. So it’s not necessarily a cost efficient method to decentralize your oracles. But as Nick Szabo would say, it’s spending pennies to save millions because of the increased security.
>the internet won't have a bigger impact than fax machine
Even they it were to make it, that still wouldn't secure that the Link token will have any use.
bravo sir
anz is a top 4 Australian bank
It won’t be a crypto they’ve never heard of once they hear their competitors have been cutting costs for all sorts of middlemen, brokers, clearing houses, auditors ect. by taking advantage of smart contracts. Once they see their market share going down, you can bet they will look to board the ship
My main concern is, where is the data going to come from? I understand smart contracts, I understand LINK can connect real data to them, but where does that data come from and how can you trust it? How do you know that it's "real world data" and not just false, if it's coming from sources that don't also have a decentralized incentive for truthful reporting like LINK?
Another reminder youre a brainlet.
Chainlink isnt made to ensure the source of Data is valid, Chainlink is made to ensure the Data being brought onto the smart contract is valid.
Exactly, fake data its all fake, worthless and you cant tell. Bullshit
basically if you are white and hold link you are betraying your own race
I just bought 2,000 and I only did it based on the fact that andreas antonpoulos endorsed it and that's enough for me.
>your a brainlet
Same thing happened with Digibyte on this board which stopped having threads last year thankfully.
chainlink isn't concerned with whether or not the data source is correct. it simply facilitates information from data sources you choose to trust into your smart contracts, and does so in a decentralized way which makes your oracles extremely secure.
Sounds really impractical... Actually feel like selling right now
This is a capypasta do not listen to this man. In all seriousness Link will either take off and reach 1000 within the next 2 years or it will just kinda grow slowly and probably be $2.00 eoy

it had a rating system and it was fucking awesome. there were even some really good strategy guides for it. anyway you would compete against other real people and it was so fucking sweet. unfortunately it looks like the site was shut down a few years ago. wouldnt it be awesome to bring back this great game and allow players to play against each other for crypto? holy fucking shit and the site could take a very small cut. if this game caught on again i bet that would be a fucking awesome idea. what do you think?
man, what if you did that
until someone writes a bot for it and takes everyones money, sure
bots would have to be banned somehow. i know on the old site some people had macros so their openings were super fast but it would be really fucking hard to use a bot for anything after the opening

It used to be possible to detect engines being used to play chess. Not is is not so sure, because of convolutional neural network chess engines such as leela zero chess.

And wouldn't it be perfect if they can manipulate an absolutely unregulated market to get back in around the same price they got in the previous cycle? They obviously can do this, and undoubtedly are. By studying the phases between the cycles you can identify in which period these operators are. Perhaps not perfectly, but enough to make more money than just trading on sentiment and your own gut feeling.

He may be autistic but I just view it as another personality type and not a flaw. Some people just have advanced intelligence and operate on another level.
Vitalik is definitely not that. He is an obvious genius. Remain uninformed.
There's nothing wrong with him. Are you angry over the fact you are failing in some areas?
I feel it's criticism from man children who will complain about another man's hair or clothing.

i don't think that's his fault, the ethereum foundation is just flat out retarded in delaying the difficulty bomb and not just pushing out casper/sharding.

Why does everyone feel obligated to fold their arms? What are they compensating/hiding?
Because the chinks steal from everyone else, including their own kind. Look up it's history and the lack of empathy the culture has. It's not a meme, the chinese legitimately do not care about anyone but themselves, family, and their name.
Basically they offloaded their 200million dollar bags and got off and made sure they were not connected to Icon and less than 6 months after Icon was 1.90.
XD well memed
What does that have to do with folding their arms?
I invested in Binance coin but when I went to go check their main office in China, it turned out that it was just some empty warehouse with CZ jerking off to anime porn.
Its what they do while they do it
I think you’d do a lot of good exposing chinks for the scum they are.
They don't have any original ideas or thoughts.
Dont forget these revolutionaries
I wanna squish these yellow insect niggers, literally smash their fucking skull in
There had been hate crimes and mass killings of Chinese population all over Asia because locals were pissed that the Chinese owned big businesses and had money.
I can agree that Chinese can be scammy, probably due to desperate circumstances of its recent history BUT not all asians are scammy. Like the West you got scammy people and you got non scammy people. Some of most sincere people I know are Koreans.
I invested in WTC because the large active twitter community convinced me it was a legit project. Pic related happened. Now I'm down >50%
If you're still reading this and invested in a Chinese project, you deserve to lose everything.
when the camera zooms into mins face somebody gotta say "if only you knew how things really are" in a thick asian accent, then short fade to black screen and then charts of ICX in freefall.

Surely monero is never going to be added.
Dude these are coins that rich boomers bought. They have no idea how to store them safely so they have to rely on Coinbase to do it for them. They could be bagholding some of these. That is why there are so many weird coins on the list.
Pretty sure another list where that applies is called "CoinMarketCap"

How much actual, physical cash do you have on hand with you, /biz? Please don't tell me you didn't sink it all in something that you can't cash out of right away.
I've got over $200k in liquid assets but never keep more than $20 on me (for black barbershop). It's more convenient to keep track of my spending if I use my cards.
Of course I always pay full taxes on any amount I cash out
I have 127k in my bank does that count?
>over 100k liquid
cashlet detected
are you being sarcastic with that last statement? why would you go through the trouble of meeting in person..
So i can buy the dip. Plus i live at home so no expenses. Comfy but humiliating senpai
Its all in the bank though. keep like $300 in small bills in the apartment for random things.
$200 in my wallet. $1000 in my safe. $10000 in my bank acct.
Physical cash? I think I have AUD$75 in my wallet
I only have a a couple half dollars under my pillow that I keep for the tooth fairly. Not underage just old and my teeth are starting to fall out again. I've paid all my taxes and just want to live a simple life.
to the moon
£70, I'm going with a new system, if I haven't got the cash I don't buy it that £70 should last me all month, cars full and so is my fridge freezer. Should save a fortune.
I don't even have 10k, but I don't see the point of having more than that liquid. Why? I already have a house and car and I can't think of any big purchases that exceed that. Not counting emergency fund of 5k which I never touch unless I'm about to be homeless or die of cancer or something.
time in market beats trying to time the market. chances are you're leaving a bunch of money of the table
Literally nothing. Just use card everywhere.

70$ in the wallet, 5k in an emergency only bank account and 1k in the primary bank accounts I stick $320 in the emergency account every week on pay day and live off the rest. Once the emegerncy account hits 10k I can start saving for a down payment.

OP is going to dead a bunch of you for your monies.
way too financially responsible for /biz/. what are you doing here?
I hope you own a gun.
Everything that isn't drugs I pay for on cards to keep track of. Currently have coupons and punch cards in my wallet. $10 in singles and loose change on desk. $200 emergency under mattress. 2.5k combined checkings/savings. ~12k in crypto, started with 3k, ATH 70k. Buy NEM faggots (my bags). For real tho
Got $900 in my bank account.
2.50 a day so i can buy my monster cans
damn son you got JUSTED
Somehow not as bad as I thought.
Whats the point? The only source of wealth that can't be stolen from you or taken by force is power, everything else is up for grabs. Money is debt owed to the government, nothing more.
cash is a meme and only useful for criminals. literally wasting money by keeping it under your mattress. no wonder those retard boomers rely on welfare
Will the price be lower then it is now before a possible bull run during the summit?
The fact is, LINK is going to share the same fate as ETH will. A lot of 'real world application' hype, with a lot of 'crypto world application' reality. Only, this billion supply coin isn't going to come close to the $1k that Ethereum hit. Happy gambling though anons.

i can't even tell if this is fud or shill
It's literally the only good coin. You're just mad you'll have to wait till mainnet before they roll out Skywire to Mumbai
Buy this coin if you’re looking forward to filing bankruptcy to avoid paying your taxes
They’re both retarded
Curious investors come to biz, gets pumped with massive shots of so᠌y, doesn't feel good and fuds - AUTISM. Many such cases!

holy shit is this real? trump is mining sky?
Yes on airforce one with a bucket of fried chicken. But its top secret so he denies it publicly
I heard he has antennas on AF1 beaming down internet to all the skyminers
>Lets make a silly reverse shilling thread instead.
Well, it worked for trump. I'd say this is a bullish comparison
That is the eventual plan yes. Before that he will gift a skyminer to chinese premier Li Keqiang
Be fearful. We are coming for you.
I can't tell if this is bad political fud or bad crypto fud.
Pick one.
They said to me, they said "you don't want anyone in Skyfleet" I don't want anyone? Excuse me? We don't want anyone in Skyfleet? Listen, we want everyone in Skyfleet, it's a beautiful fleet, so many nodes. Seven thousand nodes, can you believe that? Seven thousand nodes. But listen, we want so many people in Skyfleet but they have to be vetted, we want only the best in Skyfleet. Some people come here with their Pentium 3 HP notebooks from 2001 and some, I assume are good people, but in order for the fleet to run well we have to vet people for the test net. For the main net not so much, I'll tell you that. Main net will have this beautiful, you'll like this, a beautiful automated whitelisting tool, that anyone can use. We're going to build the whitelisting tool and Bitcoin is gonna pay for it. Believe you me. Sometimes a little centralization helps get decentralization off the ground, you have to choose your 'de' and your 'ce' wisely. Maybe a little wise ce management and some de internet. You'll see.
Why aren't you buying the absolute bottom? You know this will be at bare minimum an easy 2x when the bull market comes back.
Comfirmed chink scam, move along
Why does this shit even matter?
Is this truly Ethereum on Steroids? Or just a fake that failed to do what Ethereum does but better?
Go use it, it's amazing and filled with FUD
>truly a piece of shit
Vitalik was not interested in pussy when we met.
It has no purpose because dapps have no purpose. Putting decentralized in front of a word doesn't make your shit worth money.
many keks indeed

Mr. Larimer. As you can see, we have had our eye on you... for some time. It seems you have run an unregistered 4 billion dollar ICO for the security EOS in direct violation of US law. We are willing to give you a second chance, to wipe the slate clean. In return we only ask that you help us to bring a number of known troublemakers to justice. All we require from you is to freeze any and all accounts that we bring to you and to transfer those funds to an account of our choosing. What do you say Mr. Larimer?
Going to laugh so hard at all biztards when this hits 100$ within 2 years
reeeee
basically on-chain scaling is a really dumb meme, they have sacrificed everything of value in a public chain to get it, to be usable it will still require off-chain solutions, which render its one supposed advantage irrelevant.
maybe we'll see a successor to ethereum at some point, but not today, and certainly not from something as technically unimpressive as eos.
Get fucked retard this isn’t pre mainnet the erc20 token fud only works on people with an iq lower than 60
Devs love eos you tard
hi Dan! we love you Dan!
go look at the pitiful developer interest and support EOS is enjoying and try to tell anybody that isn't some worthless late adopter speculator like yourself that devs "love" EOS.,
You don't know shit about programming faggot.
what do you think the first successful dapps will be?
Ur a fucking idiot if you think there is any point in a dapp. Reinventing the wheel and throwing decentralized on the name doesn't do shit. Laugh when you all get burned.
Decentralized applications only works if the application actually benefits from being cencorship resistant and not be taken down but a single point of failure. Something like distributed computing, cloud storage and content/web hosting. These are the only use cases I can find for having decentralized applications.
People are already using dapps u fucking moron. 2 prime examples are bittorrent for piracy and monero for buying drugs. It's only a matter of time before more and more emerge.
read my earlier post.
Tokenize everything.
If you aren’t in EOS for 2019 you’re not making it
It's just a centralised EVM implementation lol. You could set up a private Ethereum POA system (literally an existing feature) and accomplish the same thing. Or just use Loom, which is still basically that, but sidechained to Ethereum directly for proper interoperability. EOS was a gigantic scam.
Second of all, sidechains are a completely unproven way of accomplishing the same thing as EOS (which is also unproven). So betting 100% on one if quite retarded. If you're smart you're betting on both.
thank you...one person on biz actually understands the point of this technology in the first place
I'm validated
It's barely decentralized and in a very laymen way its like 21 people running a single bank and they can do whatever they want.
yeah I wonder which one will be left standing
I'm really curious where all those transactions are coming from
Can you play space invaders on ETH?
I see a pattern here anons.
is that it? every single move is a transaction and that's how you're claiming it's the most used blockchain? isn't there massive latency with 0.5 second block times?
Unfortunately EOS is full of january crypto noobs hoping to get rich
Absolute garbage compared to ETH
this is ultimately why it will fail. 95% of the community is only trying to make a profit and doesn't care about dapps, and most are too retarded to even use wallets.
You guys are in full fucking cope mode holy shit. This is even worse than people claiming that scaling is not important just because their choice shitcoin can only do 3 transactions per second.
EOS IS basically PoA. 21 block producers who do everything on the network. You can clone ethereum and throw 21 authority nodes and it would be the same shit.
That's bullshit, you would need to completely rework every aspect of ETH until its not even ETH anymore.
Parity offers a PoA version of ethereum right now. Anybody can literally fucking download it and kickstart a PoA blockchain.
EOS is extremely robust in its design though. Anyone who says otherwise or that its easy to duplicate is fooling themselves and has no clue about the nuances of the tech. Look at every aspect of EOS and you will see layers deep design to make the coin continue to go up in value as it gains adoption.
Meanwhile EOS was created by a team of PEDOPHILES
I would love to hear why this is a strawman though
Methheads btfo
Vitaliks tweet caused that fud lel
Child porn isn’t going to be a problem. Just don’t be “friends” or “follow” people who post child porn. Problem solved

Hey baby <3
I know senpai, I’m a psyop master the market bows to me and my frens.
Do you ever think about the fact that there are literally people on /biz/ that own this shit? Fucking lol.
EOS was designed to solve it DAY ONE. If you have zero control over shit like this then your coin will be completely fucked the moment you get a decent dapp.
Please kys brainlet
A’s much as I hate the reddit and normie side of the eos community anons you like you two make me know I’m on the right team
EOS is not even decentralized.
The dumbass BP that didn't enforce the blacklist got voted out pretty quickly.
Literally kill yourselves you pathetic faggots.
Serious question - is this shit getting shit on ad nauseum for any specific reason lately? One day everyone will love and shill this shit, the next, everyone's shitting on it and lol'ing at bagholders - the fuck is it?
that dumbass BP actually moved up 10 slots after it happened
Dapps platforms are a new breed of social media and EOS will bring decentralization in ways that is unheard of in places like Facebook, twitter, twitch and youtube. Hell, just the fact alone you dont have to worry about ads for monetization of content changes shit a lot right out of the gate. No Adpocalypse is possible.
Like I said EOS will succeed if the community is active and actually votes
Paradigm shift, why else would BTC be bleeding out to fucking zero? The market is shifting to newer better coins.
is this literally the only reason crypto exists
@thechosenppl
thanks m8 - I'm hodling because I'm a fuckin idiot and I buy based on consensus and sentiment but EOS is actually one I'm willing to not dump completely at the next good rally
On that note though, crypto exists because its a form of automation on middlemen who leech off of people's success. There is no fucking reason a big time streamer should be beholden to fucking Pepsi.
Mine is “bofadeeznuts”
>after conservatives end up in full control.
You can't code or design market sentiment, i.e. perceived value.

It'a a centralized shitcoin that isn't even that fast.
I'd say 50-50 chance to go either way, that's why I only hold a small bag
The crypto revolution is coming guys.
>Should I invest stocks myself, have someone else do it for me, or have one of those new robo-advisors?
if you have the free time and motivation than DIY, if your self employed or something then hiring an advisor has more value.
Read The Intelligent Investor. Don't invest a dime until you finish it, just save it.
Basically I have very little to no time, all I do is work basically 70 to 80 hours a weeks, so probably an advisor? I don't spend much, and just mainly save, since I really don't get much down time, but I would like to begin investing asap.
Vanguard Roth IRA target date fund for when you plan to retire. Contribute max per year.
Just go to vanguard.com. Ye need nought else.
Just buy bitcoin. When the government collapses you will be among the ruling elite.
just buy vanguard emerging markets mutual funds
By the way, I DO have a possibly v e r y lucrative real estate investment opportunity, if you have 50k cash...
I was actually looking at Vanguard, but know nothing about it nor any other provider. Only reason I've heard of it is because my company offers a 401k I think with Vanguard, but haven't really looked into it much. Also, my company I work for has profit sharing and matches a certain amount for what I would pay in for my 401k, but again, I just held it off because I am usually just so busy. Also, any apps would you recommend?
Anything else should I do? If I recall you could choose low, medium and high risk options for investment, or does that mutual fund take care of that.
you don't need an app, bud. I've had a vanguard account since I was sixteen, have 6 figures in a mutual fund and close to the maximum possible in a roth ira, not even 30 yet. you should be contributing at least up to what your company matches to the 401k plan as well, that's free money.
90% vanguard index fund, 10% crypto split evenly between BTC and ETH only, unless you want to do more research
Yeah, I feel like a dummy for not doing it asap, but I didn't really understand too much and would just keep my nose to the grind stone. Also, should I open a Traditional IRA too? Or just open up multiple Roth IRAs and max them out?
ignore everybody telling you to buy something specific.
believe that depends on which tax bracket you're in. there should be some math you can do to figure out which one is optimal.
I am guessing financial advisors aren't a good thing it sounds like? So maybe low to medium risk Vanguard, as I am not near retirement, though if I could, I would like to retire early, but doubtful, though I have no debt and I just save.
I would go with a Roth IRA and you just tell Vanguard what year you want to retire and they organize your assests around that with a mix of risky-low risk and bonds.
but your right that it's better to just get in and review the situation once you have more time. just make sure to get something that's broadly diversified and you feel comfortable with.
Fucking awful wall of greentext there newfag. Didn't read.
less than 2 ETH in the contract. get in, let the faucet flow.
bump for free money
Any tips on swing trading? Pls no bully, I want to hear from people who actually make money with that (no matter the market)
good luck ever beating the market. just invest passively in an index fund
Buy high sell low
Come on, there are people out there making triple digits yearly doing that
buy red sell green insomma
there are just as many losing triple digits
Learn to read candles to determine reversals, use T3MA ribbon and buy on red candles and sell on green. Finding an obscure trading strategy can also help. Just look on trading view until you find one that is profitable. The strategy I found has net me 200% this month.
Well fuck. bABA fucked me up on calls lol
I can't say much. Just know that all of your estimates for LINK's price post-singularity are way too conservative. Bitcoins market cap combined with ETH's market cap doesn't even begin to scrape how large LINK's market cap will be once the oracle problem is solved and everything is put in to place. If you're not accumulating right now, not only do you hate money, you probably also hate yourself.
How many do you hold? How often do you accumulate?

why should i take this serious and how do i know its not just some larp. give me something
is 257k enough?
1 GDP eoy 2019
you already made it , accumulate other tokens/coins like WAX, ZRX, and so on
itty bitty baby boat
>I can’t say much
This guy again?
I was beginning to get worried. It'd been a few minutes since the last Link larp.
Enjoy your bags Linkshits.

50$ link is only 15bill. market cap. Let that sink in.
FUCK OFF YOU FUCKING RETARD FAGGOT SHILL
Really makes you think.
>Just know that all of your estimates for LINK's price post-singularity are way too conservative.
That's pretty insane. The potential for gains is enormous. $6k investment now could be $1M in ages years with just a 15b MC. You would have to be insane to not put at least some money in, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Fortune favours the bold.
$342,000 eoy. this simply cannot be resisted nor denied in good faith.
Betting on chainlink is basically betting that smart contracts will be utilized in the wider market. It's a good bet to make. Not guaranteed, but a good bet.

Literally every crypto YouTuber are all giant normie faggots. Can anyone on biz recommend any that actually know what the fuck they are talking about or any of /our/ guys that have channels ?

ReadySetCrypto is legit and doesn't shill based on people paying him to do so. He even did a review on Link in October.
Thanks I’ll check him out. Oh o just membered there’s one dude I don’t mind he’s more trader boomer tuber than just crypto tuber though. Alesio rastani or some shit like that. Been pretty accurate with his calls
no, because people who know their stuff dont share the information
Is Panama Buyers Club a real group or was that just a meme?
Those that can’t; teach
Doug knows what he's talking about. He is good friends with some of the smartest and best connected people in crypto today.
He's a blockstream shill
none of them you retard. the only way to learn is to experience or actually read shit. everyone thats on youtube is a brainlet.
much better as a poker player imo.
They all have one woman they've ever been married to and that woman is the reason most of them are still rich. They are the value seekers you fucking incel faggots.

Show her about snake juice fasting and say "HEY FATTY!!" every time you see her

Must be getting late in the UK, go to sleep.
Get her into exercise and eating properly you moron. OP said redpill, that includes the diet jew and fitness jew. She probably thinks it's her "glands" or some shit. Cure her of that. When you work out, take her along. Maybe have a separate session just for her, so you can still lift with bros on other days. Once she's into it, she can get into yoga and general female specific exercises. I actually got mine into BJJ topkek, so now she can probably fight better than I can (too busy working to roll much) and she's a lot more survivable. Feminist landwhales btfo vs combat training trad wives.
white women are trash
This is my father advice to my young children here. If you heed this warning it will make 100% difference to your life. Marriage is awesome but you got to get way from shitty cultures that push going clubbing in your fucking 30's is actually a fun way to live...ITS NOT. You will do a million times more with your life as a married man....to the right woman.

i tried. she left me after 5 years to bang other dudes. trying again but its hard.

I'm married for 9 years I make 100k and she makes 110k and my family is poor and hers has money. honestly if you don't marry someone that makes at least as much as you do or even better more than you do it's a bad investment
You sound like a pathetic faggot and I don’t blame her for forgetting you exist
Pathetic

That's true. Behind every successful man, there's a woman. But behind every downfall of man is also a woman.

What if nobody ever uses smart contracts?
Check dappradar.com and see DAU (daily active users).
they already do dipshit
Yeah that's not a lot
Fuck you are stupid. EVERYTHING that can be automated, will be automated. I think you are not going to make it since you asked a question that stupid. Mass adoption begins somewhere around 2025-2030 so prepare to hold. It’s gonna be a bumby riiiide. I wanna bumbbangbang withya body yo, I wanna bumbangbang withya body yo
What if people want to pay other people for something that software will do or a fraction of the price.
What if chainlink isnt the coin of choice for this automation
Ideology
No one is going to use decentralized oracles because they are not technically possible or even that useful.
who are these other people? I'll invest in them too.
jesus christ those numbers. holy shit. fuck thats bad.
You can't replace an existing technology with one that's 10x times worse. Decentralized money has a point, but decentralized oracles are just a fantasy.
place I work at gets hacked constantly, and they're looking into blockchain and decentralization in order to solve the issue. a decentralized oracle would be exceedingly useful.
Fucking kek
i dont understand

I was not talking about chainlink but smart contracts in general


Then crypto in general is for the most part worthless exept coins that aim to be exclusively currency which are doomed long term anyways.
wait...that's literally it? Is this worth a total mcap of 264 billion? Holy fuck this truly IS a massive bubble waiting to implode.... jesus christ.
If nobody uses smart contracts, supply chain management or oracles than crypto is dead. The blockchain will be nothing more than some fun idea from 10 years ago.
42B marketcap idea goys
Yep it's shocking how dApps are a complete meme that no one is aware of. 1 shitty android app has more users than the entire dapp ecosystem
>part of the smart contract executing is the buyer accepting the order and confirming the product code is correct.
> seller loses product
They’re cheaper, easier, and much faster than traditional contracts. Yes they will. Chainlink holders will be rewarded very soon....
0x protocol uses weth which is wrapped ether as an erc20 token you retard, thats why it doesnt show up on dappradar which only tracks ether via tx.value
>What if nobody ever uses smart contracts?
what if it is?
You can sort of fix this by using a double escrow system, (both parties are at double risk all the time) but that's a recipe for a shitshow and no one on his right mind would use it in the end, it also means you don't need Link for dick to do this.
i can do this all day bud
Buy low sell high my niggaz,
oh please there are 100s of failed inventions for every successful one
please go back to rddit thanks
who else 100% in this bitch
No. Nice digits.
dubs means it's going to go $15 to $80 just like ETH did
Im guessing its going to dump more. ETC has no adoption.
neither did ltc and it went from $1 to $50 after coinbase
Do you even understand what you're saying?
I have 0 ETH, mostly BTC + few alt bags.
i'm saying normies buy shit coins??
i'm glad that one investment firm wrote an article on the 'current' tech of ETH when the entire market is speculation
For it to go to $80, $6.5 billion would need to be put in it. for that to happen there needs to be a new bull run.
hey bud newsflash, theres no normies anymore. theyre gone. they left back in january

looks like i'm in a primed spot then
h-how do you figure that out? asking for a friend
You know if there is a bull run you can get more returns on a lower mc coin right?
no because the next bull run won't be from retail, it'll be institutional investors trading on cuck base
It's the market cap needed for each coin's individual value. Just take market cap and divide it by circulating supply.
And then coinbase dumps their etc bags on ALL of you
obvious bear until 2020 is obvious
Institutional investors have entered and left. They will be back again. But they don't just use cuck base they know how to trade coins and they'll be interested in things that they will 10x 100x 1000x in because that's what they have been doing. Yeah it'll get a buump in the next bull run. EVERYTHING will get a bump in the next bull run. That's just how the market works.
You stupid fuck for the first week coinbase will not give the forked coins. We will only be trading the current circulating supply. This is why I'm 100% in ETC right now.
Don't get me wrong I think ETC will go up. But by like 25%, not 4x. Keep your expectations in check.
6000 ETC here, hope for 3x, then cash out.
what color lambo are we getting?
Best shitcoin trade you can make right now, go 50/50 with BTC tho, the patrician coin
back to le reddit
im 100% etc as well i just want a 2x.. holy shit 4200 sats please for the love of god. Just need this to break even my losses for this whole year....
Be careful anon. We are still in a bear market. And we don't have new buyers coming in yet. It might not go up for quite some time for the reasons I stated above. Expect a much more modest pump.
No lambo for me, just gonna pay my house off.
have to risk it man. There is actually no other coin that can 2x soon. Other than this i might have to pay bitmex arthur a visit and do a yolo trade
how do you explain the 2017 may alt run? where were the january normies back then? nowhere
That was the start of the normies getting into crypto...
except the volume was way lower then now
Yes but the people in crypto right now are not normies. Lots of them are people who got justed and now hodl. The volume is higher but the returns you want wont happen with the current volume. Most of the money is already in the market. Why would people who are already in the market start buying etc after it's on coinbase? You need to either wait for a new bullrun or accept that it's only going to go up like 25% and be happy with that.
wait for vindicated screencapper post in september
I'm not a bear so if ETC does well that means everyone is going to be doing well. But I already stated why we need to be in a bull run for that to happen. And if you make 3x in September we'll be in a bull run. And you still would have made more on lower mc coins. So idk what you're trying to prove.
you're excluding the fact that its the REAL ethereum
i hope u have some etc bags man
Do you honestly think normies will care?
suicide "investor"
Why don't you guys long 100x this on bitmex then?
Why don't you short 100x this on bitmex then?

I said it's going to go up. So I don't want to lose money?
I literally feel bad for etc holders there is literally no use for this piece of shit. Someone show me a dapp using this ..someone show me some tokens that have launched on this....I'll wait. The level of deluded cope amongnst ethereum classic holders is top notch , worse than any other coin. Ppl are holding for the sole fact that they think this will reach ethereum levels but for what reason?

Why is the shekels value decreasing from its already meager position
its not really the shekel falling its the dollar rising

The rate on israeli treasury bills is 0% while the rate on us treasuries is 1.8%, capital is fleeing Israel to invest in the US. its not only happening against the shekel but against all currencies (Euro, Yuan etc)
I heard the working conditions are pretty bad anyone on biz that can chime in on this?
Look up reviews for your location if you haven't already. They will work your ass off there. Friend of mine did 55 hours in a week (which isn't abnormal for a distribution center, but nonetheless) because of Prime Day
you're gonna have 1 can for sipping, 1 can for pissing and after a 12 hour shift what difference does it make
Any other places I don't know, but they shouldn't be that bad. I hear dock is the worst, that's where they load the trucks or unload them.
In all honesty Ill probably just stop after a few months

Wait, you think 55 hours a week is that bad? How young are you?

HOW DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT JEFF BEZOS IS DESTROYING THOUSANDS OF HIS WORKERS' BODIES JUST SO HE CAN BECOME RICHER? WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NOT REALIZE 99% OF BIZ ARE THE POOR PEOPLE WHO GET JEWED OVER IN THIS WORLD? YOU AREN'T GOING TO GET RICH. YOU AREN'T GOING TO "MAKE IT". THAT CONCEIT IS EXACTLY HOW THEY GET YOU.
They say the max weight you have to lift is 50 lbs.

pundi lol wtf does this punjab pajeet shit even do
WHEN SOMEONE TELLS ME NOT TO BUY SOMETHING IT MAKES ME WANNA RESEARCH IT AND BUY
trips checked. honestly this place is different than the 4chan of old. I've taken more than one hiatus from here, but this is the worst I've seen. By your standards, everyone should just invest in the fucking literal pyramid schemes on the frontpage saying "get in now, make money later, its a pyramid hurr". This isn't even my thread
Found the le'redditor
Pundi in Punjabi literally means "checking out in a perverted way".
Been on this God forsaken site 11 years
I have a bit over million of these, 2021 january my stack'll be 2.5mm and burning is in effect. I unironically feel this amount will get me at least 50k usd before 2025
My interest piqued if true
That's not what I was implying thats not my standards. I'm trying to help biz unlike the pajeet shills. That's why I said DYOR and don't be retarded
Paying it back
Holding onto for dear life.
Pundi's X POS machine is the world’s first and smallest blockchain-based point-of-sales terminal. It will make buying crypto as easy as purchasing a bottle of water.
enjoy the bags

>doll is picked up from your front door in the morning
>wanting to clean the loads
well a guy tried it in the UK and got shut down, but I suppose there must have been a market for it
will people really pay $100 for a night with a doll? i'd be thinking half that
I feel it's a personal item. Like a toothbrush, OP.
No on wants to fuck a used sex toy
A thoroughly cleaned sex doll would be much more sanitary then a real life church going roastie
How much would you pay for an anonymous few hours alone with pic related?

The doll brothel in... I forget, it was some scandi country, was/is apparently quite popular. So popular, in fact, that the 3D meatbag whores made a stink about it on account of not liking the competition.
Charge extra for that.
You have no idea about human beings, m10.
>hire a immigrant to clean the dolls
Im thinking of putting 5k into a roth ira, is it worth it? Is there anything better to put it into?
So wouldn't that all depend on how good you are at gambling?
Yeah, it is worth it. You can contribute somewhere between 5-6k a year. It's similar to a mutual fund, but you don't get taxes when you tap into it after retirement. Or something like that. I'm not an expert at all. But if you continue to max it out every year you will thank yourself later.
It can be worth it, look at a calculator to see what you're getting into.
you need to add more overtime but its worth it if you arent planning to gamble on trading the rest of your life
I just bought back in. I thought you guys should know that.
m-mommy.
I'm betting on the parabolic increase!
